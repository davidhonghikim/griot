# **Modules Index**

## **Purpose**

This directory contains all granular, reusable modules that can be dynamically combined to create any type of node. Each module has a single responsibility and can be used across multiple contexts. The architecture is **scenario-driven** with no rigid limits on categories, subcategories, or modules - we create as many as needed for comprehensive coverage.

## **Module Design Principles**

### **Granularity Principles**
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module has one clear, focused purpose
- **Atomic Operations**: Break down complex tasks into atomic operations
- **Reusable Components**: Every module can be used in multiple contexts
- **Composable Design**: Modules can be combined in any sequence
- **Dynamic Loading**: Load modules only when needed
- **Standard Interfaces**: All modules follow consistent interface patterns
- **Scenario-Driven**: Modules created based on actual needs, not arbitrary limits
