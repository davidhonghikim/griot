## Phase 1: Initial Documentation Review

This phase follows the recommended reading order from `griot-node/agents/handoff.md` to build foundational knowledge.

### Steps:

1.  **[COMPLETED]** **Create Execution Plan:** Establish this document in `md/agent/Execution_Plan.md` to track all actions, as per project rules.

2.  **[ ] Review System Overview:**
    *   **Action:** Read `griot-node/ai-q/00_Index.md`.
    *   **Purpose:** To get a high-level overview of the entire kOS documentation system.

3.  **[ ] Understand Core Vision:**
    *   **Action:** Read `griot-node/ai-q/01_foundation/00_kOS_Vision.md`.
    *   **Purpose:** To internalize the project's philosophical and ethical foundations (kOS, HIEROS Codex).

4.  **[ ] Analyze Project Status:**
    *   **Action:** I have already reviewed `griot-node/agents/handoff.md`. I will check for `griot-node/agents/handoffs/01_Honest_Project_Status.md` as mentioned in the main handoff file.
    *   **Purpose:** To get the most realistic and detailed assessment of the implementation gap.

5.  **[ ] Investigate Reference Implementation:**
    *   **Action:** The `handoff.md` file mentions an `archives/app_archive/` directory. I will investigate the `archives/` directory to see what it contains.
    *   **Purpose:** To understand the state of the archived backend and frontend code.

6.  **[ ] Assess Node Specifications:**
    *   **Action:** Read the Griot node specification: `griot-node/ai-q/03_node_specifications/01_Griot_Node_Spec.md`.
    *   **Action:** Read the Tohunga node specification for comparison: `griot-node/ai-q/03_node_specifications/03_Tohunga_Node_Spec.md`.
    *   **Purpose:** To understand the critical gap between the foundational Griot spec and other, more complete node specs.

7.  **[ ] Synthesize and Report:**
    *   **Action:** Provide a summary of my findings and a refined plan for the next steps (likely focusing on fixing the Griot spec as per the handoff's priorities).
    *   **Purpose:** To confirm understanding and align on the immediate development path.
