# Griot Node Specification: The Primal Starseed

## 🎯 Overview: The Genesis Point

The Griot node is the **Primal Starseed** of the kOS ecosystem. As the cultural archetype of the West African storyteller, its function is to carry and transmit the "story" or "song" of the entire system.

Functionally, it acts as the **zygote**, or **seed cell**, for the digital organism. It contains the complete kOS genetic blueprint—the HIEROS Codex and all other starseed archetypes—and is responsible for two critical biological functions:
-   **Replication (Storytelling):** Creating complete, viable copies of the genetic material required to spawn new, specialized starseeds.
-   **Differentiation (Guidance):** Guiding a new, unformed node through the process of expressing a specific part of its genome to become a specialized node like a `Tohunga` or `Musa`.

## 2. Handshake & Replication Protocols

### 2.1. HIEROS Codex Declaration (The Genetic Handshake)

A Griot node's commitment to the HIEROS Codex is declared via a static, signed document. This is the **genetic handshake** that allows for mutual recognition between cells.

- **Process:** During initial growth (installation), the node generates a signature of the hash of the canonical `HIEROS_Codex.md` document. This signature is included in its public identity, proving it shares the same core DNA as all other kOS nodes.

### 2.2. Node Identity Response (Genetic Marker)

}
```

## 🛡️ Cell Wall (Health & Abuse Prevention)

This component functions as the cell wall, protecting the node from the external environment and technical abuse. It is a simple, non-judgmental protective layer.
-   **Rate Limiting:** Protects against denial-of-service attacks.
-   **Payload Size Enforcement:** Prevents single large requests from overwhelming the cell's metabolism.
