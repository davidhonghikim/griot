# **Event Orchestrator**

## **Overview**

The Event Orchestrator module provides advanced event orchestration capabilities, enabling management of event-driven workflows, event routing, event correlation, and complex event processing. It handles high-volume event streams, ensures event ordering, and provides sophisticated event processing patterns for distributed systems.

## **Core Principles**
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Support event-driven workflows and processing patterns.
- **Event Routing**: Provide intelligent event routing and distribution.
- **Event Correlation**: Correlate related events across distributed systems.
- **Complex Event Processing**: Enable complex event processing and pattern recognition.

## **Function Specifications**

### **Core Functions**
- **Event Management**: Manage event streams and event processing.
- **Event Routing**: Route events to appropriate handlers and consumers.
- **Event Correlation**: Correlate related events across distributed systems.
- **Complex Event Processing**: Process complex event patterns and sequences.
- **Event Ordering**: Ensure proper event ordering and consistency.
- **Event Monitoring**: Monitor event processing and performance.

### **TypeScript Interfaces**
