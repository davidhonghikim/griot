summary:
  description: |
    This guide documents the canonical build, HTML, and Vite configuration pattern for all Chrome extensions in the kOS ecosystem. It is based on the working kai-cd and OWU+ extension implementations. All agents must follow this pattern for compatibility and maintainability.

html_pattern:
  placement: "HTML files (popup.html, sidepanel.html, tab.html) must be at the root of the extension project, not in public/."
  script_tag: "Each HTML file must reference the source TSX/TS entry point (e.g., <script type='module' src='/src/popup.tsx'></script>). Vite will handle transformation during build."
  root_div: "Each HTML file must have <div id='root'></div> for React mounting."

vite_config:
  rollup_input: |
    The Vite config must use the root-level HTML files as entry points:
      input: {
        popup: resolve(__dirname, 'popup.html'),
        sidepanel: resolve(__dirname, 'sidepanel.html'),
        tab: resolve(__dirname, 'tab.html'),
        ...
      }
  output: "Vite will generate the correct JS bundles and HTML in dist/."

troubleshooting:
  - problem: "Popup or panel fails to load, 404 for .tsx file"
    cause: "HTML file is in the wrong location or script tag points to built JS instead of source TSX."
    solution: "Move HTML to root, use source TSX in script tag, and rebuild."
  - problem: "Build fails with Rollup import error for missing .tsx entry"
    cause: "Vite input references a file that does not exist."
    solution: "Create the missing entry point or update Vite config."
  - problem: "Extension loads but UI is blank"
    cause: "No #root div or React entry not mounting."
    solution: "Ensure <div id='root'></div> is present and entry file renders to it."

notes:
  - "Always test in Chrome after build."
  - "Do not use leading slashes in script src for built JS; use for source TSX only."
  - "Update this doc if the build pattern changes."
