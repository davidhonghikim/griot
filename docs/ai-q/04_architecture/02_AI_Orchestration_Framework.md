# AI Orchestration Framework

**Source**: User Directive
**Status**: Adopted

---

## 1. Overview: AI as Orchestrator

The core kOS architecture shall focus on providing raw capabilities and standardized interfaces, while AI agents take on the responsibility of composing and orchestrating those capabilities to achieve specific goals. The system is a framework, not a static application.

An AI-driven orchestration layer will dynamically select and compose the optimal "tools" (node functionalities) to fulfill a user's request.

## 2. Key Architectural Changes

### 2.1. Simplified Node Architecture

Application-specific logic will be removed from individual nodes. The core functionality becomes more generic and modular.

-   **Griot:** Serves as the central library host, manages deployments, and monitors the health of deployed services. It orchestrates updates and checks with the central orchestration engine.
-   **Tohunga:** Validates, cleans, structures, and shares data from various sources via standardized connectors. Its validation functions are designed to work with any compatible data source.
-   **Other Nodes:** The principle of generic, modular functionality applies to all other node classes.

### 2.2. AI Agent as Planner & Executor

1.  A requesting entity submits a high-level goal or intent to the orchestrator.
2.  The orchestrator's AI agent analyzes the objective.
3.  The agent queries the ecosystem to discover available nodes and their capabilities (Roles).
4.  It generates a plan and the necessary code implementation to fulfill the request.
5.  It deploys the solution into the ecosystem.
6.  The agent uses a continuous feedback loop from the system to learn and improve the efficiency and quality of its future plans.

## 3. Core Implementation Requirements

### 3.1. KLF for Universal Service Invocation

The Kind Link Framework (KLF) protocol must be revised to support **dynamic service discovery and invocation**.
- A node must be able to query the network for another node that meets specific capability criteria.
- It must then be able to invoke its functions through a standardized interface.
- All nodes must share a common set of base KLF calls and a foundational functional framework to simplify communication and orchestration.

### 3.2. Abstract Orchestration Engine

A dedicated component, likely residing within Griot or a new "Orchestrator" node, will be responsible for:
-   Analyzing incoming requests.
-   Decomposing them into sub-tasks.
-   Identifying the node capabilities required to accomplish each sub-task.

### 3.3. AI-Powered Tool Selection & Composition

An AI agent must be implemented for selecting the optimal nodes/capabilities for each task. It will consider factors such as:
-   **Capabilities:** Based on the `RoleManifest` of each node.
-   **Performance:** Based on real-time and historical monitoring data.
-   **Trust & Reputation:** Based on a distributed reputation system.
-   **Cultural Affinity:** If relevant to the nature of the task.

### 3.4. Secure Execution & Monitoring

-   A secure execution environment (e.g., sandboxing, containerization) is mandatory for running composed workflows.
-   The system must monitor the execution of all workflows and collect metrics to feed the AI's learning loop.

### 3.5. AI Feedback & Learning

-   Reinforcement learning or other appropriate ML techniques should be used to train the AI agent to make better orchestration decisions over time.
-   A mechanism for incorporating human feedback is required to correct mistakes and improve the quality of outcomes.

## 4. Code Design & Quality Mandates

1.  **RoleManifest:** A `RoleManifest.json` or similar file must be a standard component for every node, automatically populated at startup. This manifest declares the node's capabilities to the network.
2.  **Interface Compliance:** Strict interface compliance is a high-priority requirement for all base libraries and node components.
3.  **Security:** The highest level of security must be implemented, including rigorous code analysis, build-time testing, and sandboxing to prevent the introduction of malicious code or backdoors.
4.  **Orchestration Function:** A single, unified function must exist within the kOS core to manage the end-to-end process of:
    -   a. Pulling workflow code.
    -   b. Validating its origin and safety.
    -   c. Installing it.
    -   d. Performing security and health checks.
    -   e. Executing the workflow.

## 5. Agent Development Scope

Agents working on this system are **not responsible for**:
-   Creating highly specialized, domain-specific machine learning models.
-   Defining the *specific* solutions to end-user requests.

The focus is on building the foundational, generic pieces of this orchestration framework. All development efforts should be directed toward these components to maximize their function and flexibility.
