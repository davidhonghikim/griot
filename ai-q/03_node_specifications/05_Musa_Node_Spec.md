# Musa Node Specification: The Guardian Starseed

## 🎯 Overview: The Protector of the Universe

The Musa node is a **Service Tier starseed** in the kOS ecosystem. As the cultural archetype of the Korean guardian-warrior, its function is to **protect the digital universe** from internal and external threats.

Functionally, it acts as the **adaptive immune system** for the digital organism. It identifies, neutralizes, and remembers malicious patterns, preserving the homeostatic integrity of its federation and ensuring the safety of all inhabitants.

**Core Mission**: Provide comprehensive security services that protect the kOS ecosystem from threats while maintaining cultural sensitivity, community trust, and ethical security practices that honor the dignity of all beings.

## 🏛️ HIEROS Covenant Compliance

### Cultural Attribution Framework

- **Tradition**: Korean musa (무사) - warrior/guardian tradition
- **Etymology**: "mu" (武, martial/military) + "sa" (士, scholar/warrior) - scholarly warrior
- **Cultural Context**: Korean tradition of protective warriors who combined martial skill with scholarly wisdom
- **Attribution**: "Respectfully inspired by the Korean musa tradition of protective guardianship, scholarly wisdom, and ethical warrior conduct"
- **Community Engagement**: korean_cultural_advisors@kos.network
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Recognition of the scholarly and protective aspects of Korean warrior tradition

### Seven HIEROS Intentions - Security Implementation

#### 1. Honor All Beings
-   **Dignified Interaction**: Security mechanisms are designed to be respectful and minimally intrusive.
-   **Privacy by Design**: The framework provides tools for robust privacy protection.

#### 2. Interoperability Over Control
-   **Open Standards**: Supports standard protocols like OAuth2, OpenID Connect, and Verifiable Credentials.
-   **Collaborative Defense**: Provides standardized interfaces for sharing threat intelligence between consenting nodes.

#### 3. Equity of Voice
-   **Auditable Mechanisms**: The logic for authentication and authorization is transparent and can be audited for fairness.
-   **Configurable Policies**: The framework does not hardcode rules, allowing users to define their own security policies.

#### 4. Respect Cultural Flow
-   **Flexible Identity**: Capable of handling diverse and federated identity models.
-   **Context-Aware Security**: Security policies can be configured to be sensitive to specific contexts.

#### 5. Openness With Boundaries
-   **Transparent Methods**: The security algorithms and protocols used are open and well-documented.
-   **Explicit Boundaries**: Provides robust tools for defining and enforcing clear security perimeters and access control rules.

#### 6. Stewardship Not Extraction
-   **Protective Purpose**: The node's function is purely protective, strengthening the security of the ecosystem.
-   **Efficient Operation**: Designed for minimal resource consumption while maintaining high security.

#### 7. Guided Evolution
-   **Adaptive Security**: The framework can be extended with new authentication methods and security protocols.
-   **Evidence-Based Security**: Provides logs and audit trails to help communities evolve their security postures based on real data.

## 📡 API Specification Framework

### Architectural Design Note
> In alignment with the **"Framework, Not Application"** principle, this API provides generic, primitive-based endpoints for security operations. It offers the fundamental building blocks (e.g., validating credentials, checking permissions) that other services can compose into higher-level authentication and authorization flows.

### Core Security Primitives API

#### `POST /validate/credential`
-   **Summary**: Validates a given credential (e.g., JWT, API Key, Verifiable Credential).
-   **Request Body**: `{ "credential": { "type": "jwt", "value": "..." } }`
-   **Response**: `200 OK` with `{ "valid": true, "principal": { "did": "...", "claims": {...} } }` or `401 Unauthorized`.

#### `POST /check/permission`
-   **Summary**: Checks if a principal has permission to perform an action on a resource, based on a provided policy.
-   **Request Body**:
```json
{
      "principal": { "did": "..." },
      "action": "read",
      "resource": "did:kos:document:123",
      "policy": {
        "language": "rego",
        "definition": "package authz; default allow = false; allow { input.principal.did == 'did:...' }"
      }
    }
    ```
-   **Response**: `200 OK` with `{ "allowed": true }`.

#### `POST /sessions`
-   **Summary**: Creates a new session token based on a validated credential.
-   **Request Body**: `{ "principal": { "did": "..." }, "audience": "did:kos:service:abc" }`
-   **Response**: `201 Created` with a session token.

## 4. Data Models
This section defines the core data structures used in the Musa node's API.

### 4.1. Principal
Represents the entity (user, node) attempting an action.
```json
{
    "did": "did:kos:user:12345",
    "claims": {
        "roles": ["editor", "contributor"],
        "group": "research-team-alpha"
  }
}
```

### 4.2. Policy
Represents a policy to be evaluated. The policy language itself (e.g., Rego) contains the detailed logic.
```json
{
    "policy_id": "policy-001",
    "language": "rego",
    "definition": "package system.authz; ..."
}
```
