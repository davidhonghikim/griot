  content: 'The Sachem Node is the **consensus engine and social cognition layer**
    of the Kindai Operating System. While other nodes may perform raw analysis (Hakim)
    or store memories (Yachay), the Sachem''s role is to facilitate agreement, establish
    collective truth, and manage the reputation and trust models between all other
    nodes.


    Its core function is to prevent informational schisms and ensure that the kOS
    agent swarm can operate from a shared, validated understanding of its environment
    and goals. It is the distributed nerve ganglion that allows the independent nodes
    to form a cohesive, functional whole.'
