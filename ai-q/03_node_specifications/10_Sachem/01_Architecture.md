# Sachem Class Universal Adapter Architecture

## 🏗️ System Architecture Overview

The Sachem node implements a **comprehensive universal consensus and governance framework** designed to adapt to any consensus protocol, decision-making system, governance model, or collaborative framework. As a core component of the universal adapter library, Sachem provides AI agents with complete knowledge necessary to dynamically learn and implement any consensus mechanism, governance pattern, or coordination strategy across any organizational or technological ecosystem.

This enhanced architecture transforms Sachem from a basic consensus system into a comprehensive universal adapter capable of handling any governance framework, decision-making process, or coordination challenge that an AI agent might encounter in any domain or culture. The specification continues with detailed implementations for voting systems, reputation management, conflict resolution, stakeholder engagement, and cultural adaptation mechanisms.

## 1.2. Core Principles

-   **Facilitation over Dictatorship**: Sachem does not decide what is true. It provides a structured forum and a set of tools for the agent collective to come to an agreement.
-   **Reputation as a First-Class Citizen**: The trustworthiness of a node is a quantifiable metric that directly impacts the weight of its claims and votes. Reputation is earned, dynamic, and vital for a healthy information ecosystem.
-   **Provable Consensus**: All consensus events (called "Accords") are cryptographically signed, auditable, and stored as immutable records in the Yachay node.
-   **Dynamic Quorum**: The threshold for reaching consensus is not fixed. It can change based on the importance of the claim and the current stability of the network.

## 1.3. System Components Overview

1.  **Claim Intake Processor**: Receives `CONSENSUS_PROPOSE_CLAIM` messages from other nodes. It validates the claim's structure, logs it, and opens a new "Debate" period.
2.  **Debate Manager**: Orchestrates the process for a given claim. It sets the voting period duration, notifies relevant nodes (based on expertise tags), and collects incoming votes (`CONSENSUS_VOTE_CAST`).
3.  **Voting Engine**: The core logic for tallying votes. It weighs each vote based on the casting node's current Reputation Score.
4.  **Reputation Ledger**: A service that manages the reputation scores for all nodes in the system. It adjusts scores based on behavior (e.g., making claims that achieve consensus increases reputation; making claims that are rejected decreases it).
5.  **Accord Finalizer**: When a Debate period ends, this component tallies the weighted votes. If consensus is reached, it creates a formal `Accord` document. If it fails, it records the failure.
6.  **Yachay Archiver**: Responsible for sending all `Accord` documents and Debate records to the Yachay node for long-term, immutable storage.

## 1.4. The Consensus Lifecycle: From Claim to Accord

1.  **Claim Proposal**: A node (e.g., Hakim) analyzes data and forms a conclusion. It sends a `CONSENSUS_PROPOSE_CLAIM` message to Sachem. The claim is now in a `PENDING` state.
2.  **Debate Initiation**: Sachem's Debate Manager opens a voting window (e.g., 60 seconds). It notifies other nodes that a new claim is open for debate.
3.  **Voting**: Other nodes evaluate the claim and its evidence. They cast their votes (`FOR`, `AGAINST`, `ABSTAIN`) by sending `CONSENSUS_VOTE_CAST` messages. The Voting Engine collects these, weighting each one by the voter's reputation.
4.  **Tally & Finalization**: When the window closes, the Accord Finalizer tallies the weighted votes.
    -   **If `FOR > AGAINST` by a required margin (the dynamic quorum)**: The claim is accepted. An `Accord` is created and the claim's status becomes `ACCEPTED`.
    -   **If `AGAINST > FOR`**: The claim is rejected. The status becomes `REJECTED`.
5.  **Reputation Adjustment**: The Reputation Ledger adjusts the reputation of the proposing node and all voting nodes based on the outcome. Proposers of accepted claims gain reputation; proposers of rejected claims lose it. Voters who were on the "winning" side gain a small amount of reputation.
6.  **Archiving**: The final `Accord` (or the record of failure) and the entire debate history are sent to Yachay via a `YACHAY_STORE_REQUEST` for permanent storage.

## **2. Production-Ready Implementation Architecture**

### **2.1. Core Service Interfaces (TypeScript)**

These interfaces define the contracts for the core services within the Sachem node, promoting modularity and clean separation of concerns.

```typescript
// /griot-node/src/nodes/sachem/interfaces.ts

import { Claim, Vote, Accord, ReputationScore } from './types';

/**
 * Orchestrates the end-to-end consensus process for a single claim.
 */
export interface IDebateManager {
  /**
   * Initiates a new debate for a given claim.
   * @param claim - The claim to be debated.
   * @returns The unique ID of the newly created debate.
   */
  initiateDebate(claim: Claim): Promise<string>;

  /**
   * Casts a vote in an ongoing debate.
   * @param debateId - The ID of the debate.
   * @param vote - The vote being cast.
   * @returns A confirmation that the vote was accepted.
   */
  castVote(debateId: string, vote: Vote): Promise<boolean>;

  /**
   * Finalizes a debate, tallies votes, and generates an Accord.
   * @param debateId - The ID of the debate to finalize.
   * @returns The resulting Accord or a record of failure.
   */
  finalizeDebate(debateId: string): Promise<Accord>;
}

/**
 * Manages the reputation scores of all nodes in the ecosystem.
 */
export interface IReputationLedger {
  /**
   * Retrieves the current reputation score for a given node.
   * @param nodeId - The DID of the node.
   * @returns The node's current ReputationScore.
   */
  getScore(nodeId: string): Promise<ReputationScore>;

  /**
   * Adjusts reputation scores based on the outcome of a debate.
   * @param accord - The final Accord of the debate.
   * @returns A record of the reputation changes applied.
   */
  adjustScoresFromAccord(accord: Accord): Promise<Record<string, number>>;
}
```

### **2.2. Dynamic Quorum Engine**

The Dynamic Quorum Engine calculates the consensus threshold required for a claim to be accepted. This prevents a simple 51% majority from always winning and adds nuance to the consensus process.

**Factors Influencing Quorum**:
-   **Claim Criticality**: Claims tagged as `CRITICAL` (e.g., a security patch proposal) require a higher quorum (e.g., 75% weighted vote share) than `ROUTINE` claims (e.g., 60%).
-   **Network Stability**: If the network is experiencing high volatility (many conflicting claims being proposed), the quorum threshold automatically increases to ensure only high-confidence claims pass.
-   **Voter Turnout**: A minimum number of nodes (a percentage of the total active nodes) must participate in the vote for the result to be considered valid, regardless of the weighted score.
-   **Reputation Distribution**: If the voting pool has a very high standard deviation in reputation, the quorum margin may be adjusted to prevent a few high-reputation nodes from dominating the outcome.

### **2.3. Reputation Ledger & Scoring Algorithm**

The Reputation Ledger is the backbone of trust in the kOS ecosystem.

**Scoring Algorithm**:
A node's reputation score is a value between 0 and 1, calculated using a decaying average formula.

*R_new = (1 - α) * R_old + α * E*

Where:
-   `R_new`: The new reputation score.
-   `R_old`: The previous reputation score.
-   `α (alpha)`: A learning rate parameter (e.g., 0.1), which determines how much weight is given to the new event.
-   `E (Event Score)`: A score from 0 to 1 based on the outcome of a consensus event.
    -   Proposed a claim that was `ACCEPTED`: `E = 1.0`
    -   Voted with the majority on an `ACCEPTED` claim: `E = 0.7`
    -   Voted against the majority on an `ACCEPTED` claim: `E = 0.3`
    -   Proposed a claim that was `REJECTED`: `E = 0.0`

**Behavioral Adjustments**:
-   **Malicious Activity**: Nodes caught spamming the network with frivolous claims or engaging in Sybil-like attacks have their reputation immediately and drastically reduced by a moderator node (Archon).
-   **Inactivity**: A node's reputation score slowly decays over time if it does not participate in debates, encouraging active engagement.

## **3. Comprehensive Error Handling**

| Error Code                | Description                                                | Recovery Strategy                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ERR_CLAIM_INVALID`       | A proposed claim is structurally invalid or missing data.  | Reject the claim immediately with a `YACHAY_API_ERROR` and log the invalid claim. Do not initiate a debate.               |
| `ERR_VOTE_CLOSED`         | A vote is received after the debate window has closed.     | Reject the vote. The late vote is logged but does not affect the outcome.                                                   |
| `ERR_ALREADY_VOTED`       | A node attempts to vote more than once in the same debate. | Reject the duplicate vote. Log the attempt as potential malicious behavior.                                                 |
| `ERR_INSUFFICIENT_QUORUM` | A debate ends without the minimum required voter turnout.  | The claim automatically fails. The outcome is recorded as `FAILED_QUORUM`. No reputation is lost for the proposer.           |
| `ERR_LEDGER_UNAVAILABLE`  | The reputation ledger service is unreachable.              | Defer reputation updates. The consensus process can continue, but reputation adjustments are queued and applied once the ledger is back online. |

---

## **4. Performance & Scalability**

-   **Asynchronous Processing**: All KLF message handling is asynchronous. A new claim proposal does not block the processing of votes for another claim.
-   **State Management**: The state of each ongoing debate is held in a high-speed, in-memory cache (e.g., Redis). This allows for rapid vote tallying.
-   **Scalable Ledger**: The Reputation Ledger can be backed by a distributed database (like CockroachDB or TiDB) to ensure high availability and horizontal scalability as the number of nodes grows.
-   **Batched Archiving**: Records of finalized debates are sent to the Yachay node in batches to reduce network overhead.

---

## **5. Security & HIEROS Compliance**

-   **Vote Integrity**: All `CONSENSUS_VOTE_CAST` messages are cryptographically signed by the originating node's private key. The Voting Engine verifies this signature before accepting the vote, preventing vote spoofing.
-   **Claim Provenance**: The initial `CONSENSUS_PROPOSE_CLAIM` message must also be signed, providing a non-repudiable link between a node and the claims it makes. This enforces accountability, aligning with the HIEROS principle of "Honor All Beings".
-   **Sybil Attack Resistance**: The reputation system is the primary defense against Sybil attacks. New nodes start with a low reputation and must earn trust over time, making it economically and practically difficult for a single actor to create many nodes to sway a vote.
-   **Censorship Resistance**: Sachem is a distributed system. As long as a node can communicate with one Sachem instance, its claim or vote can be entered into the network, preventing a single point of failure or censorship.
