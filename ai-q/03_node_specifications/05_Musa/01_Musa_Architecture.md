🔒 SECURITY VALIDATION FLOW
KLF Message In → Authentication Check (Credential/Session)
    ↓
Policy-Based Authorization Check (Action, Resource)
    ↓
Threat Assessment (Behavioral Analysis)
    ↓
✅ Access Granted → Cryptographic Operation (if needed) → Audit Log
    or
❌ Access Denied → Incident Report (if needed) → Audit Log
