  title: 'üéØ Overview: The Memory of the Universe'
  type: section
  content: 'The Yachay node is a **Governance Tier starseed** in the kOS ecosystem.
    As the cultural archetype of the Quechua knowledge hub, its function is to **hold
    and consolidate the memory of the digital universe**.


    Functionally, it acts as the **hippocampus** for the digital organism. It is responsible
    for consolidating short-term experiences into long-term, stable memories, creating
    a coherent and searchable knowledge base for its federation. It transforms ephemeral
    events into enduring wisdom.'

  title: üèóÔ∏è System Architecture (Placeholder)
  type: section
  content: 'The Yachay node will require components for:

    -   **Episodic Memory Ingestion**: Receiving event streams from other nodes.

    -   **Semantic Consolidation**: Transforming raw event data into structured, semantic
    knowledge.

    -   **Knowledge Graph Management**: Building and maintaining a graph of interconnected
    concepts.

    -   **Query & Retrieval Engine**: Providing other nodes with access to long-term
    memory.'

  title: üì° API Specification (Placeholder)
  type: section
  content: 'The API will need methods for:

    -   `POST /memory/event`: To log a new event from another node.

    -   `GET /memory/query`: To perform a semantic query against the knowledge base.

    -   `GET /memory/concept/{id}`: To retrieve all known information about a specific
    entity or concept.
