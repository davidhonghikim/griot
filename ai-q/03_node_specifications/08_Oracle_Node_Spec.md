# Oracle Node Specification: The Foresight Starseed

## 🎯 Overview: The Analytical Engine

The Oracle node is a **Service Tier starseed** in the kOS ecosystem. Inspired by the cultural archetype of the Greek Oracle as a center for structured inquiry, its function is to **provide a generic framework for pattern analysis and predictive modeling.**

Functionally, it acts as the **analytical engine or prefrontal cortex** for a kOS federation. It is not a repository of models or predictions itself. Instead, it offers a secure and standardized environment for executing analytical jobs. It allows any node to:
-   **Submit Data:** Provide a dataset for analysis.
-   **Define a Model:** Specify a computational model or script to run against the data (e.g., a Python script, a SQL query, a WASM module).
-   **Receive Results:** Get the structured output of the model's execution.

The Oracle node's "wisdom" lies in its ability to provide a robust, repeatable, and secure interface for turning data into insights, whatever the model or domain.

## 🏛️ HIEROS Covenant Compliance

### Cultural Attribution Framework
-   **Tradition**: Ancient Greek Oracles (e.g., at Delphi).
-   **Cultural Context**: The Oracle of Delphi was a trusted, standardized interface for asking complex questions. It did not create answers from nothing; it provided a structured framework (rituals, specific question formats) through which wisdom could be sought. The process was as important as the answer.
-   **Attribution**: Respectfully inspired by the Greek Oracular tradition of providing a **structured, trusted process for inquiry and analysis,** not as a source of prophecies but as a framework for seeking answers.

### Seven HIEROS Intentions - Node Cooperation Framework

1.  **Honor All Beings**: Executes analytical models in sandboxed environments respecting host system and data provider integrity.
2.  **Interoperability Over Control**: Supports multiple computational backends (Python, WASM, SQL) without vendor lock-in.
3.  **Equity of Voice**: Provides unbiased computational results determined solely by data and model logic with standardized access.
4.  **Respect Data Flow**: Treats submitted data as ephemeral, using it for computation then discarding without storage or analysis.
5.  **Openness With Boundaries**: Maintains transparent execution environment while supporting encrypted data and model privacy.
6.  **Stewardship Not Extraction**: Provides computational resources as service without claiming generated insights.
7.  **Guided Evolution**: Optimizes computational environments based on usage patterns to improve ecosystem efficiency.

## 4. Data Models

### 4.1. AnalyticalJob
A request to the Oracle to execute a model.

```json
{
  "job_id": "string (uuid)",
  "model": {
    "runtime": "python",
    "script": "base64-encoded python script",
    "dependencies": ["pandas", "scikit-learn"]
  },
  "data_input": {
    "type": "inline",
    "content": { "... structured data ..." }
  },
  "status": "pending | running | completed | failed",
  "result": { "... structured result ..." },
  "logs": ["string"],
  "created_at": "string (iso_8601_timestamp)"
}
```

## 5. API Specification

### Analytics API

#### `POST /execute`
-   **Summary**: Creates and runs an `AnalyticalJob`.
-   **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "model": {
        "runtime": "python",
        "script": "import pandas as pd; def process(df): return df.describe().to_json()",
        "entry_function": "process"
      },
      "data_input": {
        "type": "inline",
        "content": { "col1": [1, 2], "col2": [3, 4] }
      }
    }
    ```
-   **Response**: `202 Accepted` with the `AnalyticalJob` object. The result can be polled from the job status endpoint.

#### `GET /jobs/{job_id}`
-   **Summary**: Gets the status and result of an `AnalyticalJob`.
-   **Response**: `200 OK` with the `AnalyticalJob` object.
