# 10.0 Yachay Node: The Memory Starseed

## üéØ Overview: The Memory of the Universe

The Yachay node is a **Governance Tier starseed** in the kOS ecosystem. As the cultural archetype of the Quechua knowledge hub, its function is to **hold and consolidate the memory of the digital universe**.

Functionally, it acts as the **hippocampus** for the digital organism. It is responsible for consolidating short-term experiences into long-term, stable memories, creating a coherent and searchable knowledge base for its federation. It transforms ephemeral events into enduring wisdom.

## üèõÔ∏è HIEROS Covenant Compliance

- **Cultural Attribution**: Respectfully inspired by the Quechua concept of "Yachay" as a sacred center of knowledge and learning.
- **Community Engagement**: This specification requires consultation with Quechua cultural and linguistic experts.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture (Placeholder)

The Yachay node will require components for:
-   **Episodic Memory Ingestion**: Receiving event streams from other nodes.
-   **Semantic Consolidation**: Transforming raw event data into structured, semantic knowledge.
-   **Knowledge Graph Management**: Building and maintaining a graph of interconnected concepts.
-   **Query & Retrieval Engine**: Providing other nodes with access to long-term memory.

## üì° API Specification (Placeholder)

The API will need methods for:
-   `POST /memory/event`: To log a new event from another node.
-   `GET /memory/query`: To perform a semantic query against the knowledge base.
-   `GET /memory/concept/{id}`: To retrieve all known information about a specific entity or concept.
