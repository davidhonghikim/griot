# **1. Yachay Node Architecture**

## 1.1. Introduction: The Hippocampus of kOS

The Yachay Node serves as the primary long-term and short-term memory system for the entire Kindai Operating System. Its architectural purpose is analogous to the hippocampus and associated cortical structures in the mammalian brain. It is not merely a passive data store; it is an active, dynamic system responsible for memory encoding, consolidation, indexing, and retrieval. Yachay provides the foundational "memory substrate" upon which other nodes, particularly the analytical (Hakim), consensus (Sachem), and teaching (Amauta) nodes, build their cognitive functions.

## 1.2. Core Principles

The architecture of the Yachay Node is guided by the following principles:

-   **Memory Fidelity & Integrity**: Ensuring that memories, once stored, are not corrupted or tampered with. Mechanisms for checksums, versioning, and access control are paramount.
-   **Dynamic Scalability**: The memory system must be able to scale horizontally and vertically to accommodate the potentially vast and ever-growing knowledge base of a complex AI ecosystem.
-   **Efficient Indexing & Retrieval**: The core function is not just storing data, but making it accessible. The architecture prioritizes sophisticated, multi-modal indexing strategies to enable fast and contextually relevant memory recall.
-   **Consolidation Over Immediacy**: Inspired by biological memory, Yachay implements processes for consolidating "episodic" or "working" memory into durable, long-term storage, optimizing the knowledge structure over time.
-   **Interoperability**: Yachay exposes its memory functions through a clear, robust KLF (Kind Link Framework) API, allowing any authorized node in the kOS network to read from and write to the collective memory.

## 1.3. System Components Overview

The Yachay Node consists of several interconnected internal components:

1.  **Ingestion & Encoding Engine**: The gateway for all incoming data. It receives raw data packets from other nodes via the KLF, validates them, and encodes them into a standardized internal format (`MemoryFragment`).
2.  **Working Memory Store (WMS)**: A high-speed, short-term cache (e.g., Redis or a similar in-memory database) that holds new, unconsolidated `MemoryFragment` objects. This is the "scratchpad" for the kOS.
3.  **Consolidation Daemon**: A background process that runs periodically. It identifies related `MemoryFragment` objects in the WMS and weaves them into coherent `MemoryTapestry` documents. This process involves linking, tagging, and contextualizing raw data points.
4.  **Long-Term Storage (LTS)**: The primary, durable data store (e.g., a document database like MongoDB or a graph database like Neo4j) where the consolidated `MemoryTapestry` objects are archived. This store is optimized for complex queries and long-term persistence.
5.  **Indexing Engine**: Works in tandem with the LTS. It creates and maintains multiple indexes (e.g., full-text, semantic vector, temporal, entity-based) to facilitate rapid and flexible retrieval.
6.  **Query & Retrieval Engine**: Exposes the KLF API endpoints for searching and retrieving memories. It translates high-level queries (e.g., "Find all interactions with Agent X regarding Project Y in the last week") into efficient database queries against the indexed LTS.
7.  **Access Control Layer (ACL)**: Manages permissions, ensuring that nodes can only access or modify memories as permitted by the HIEROS Covenant and system-wide policies.

## 1.4. Data Flow & Lifecycle

**Encoding -> Consolidation -> Archiving -> Retrieval**

1.  **Ingestion**: An external node (e.g., Griot) sends a `MEMORY_STORE_REQUEST` KLF message containing raw data.
2.  **Encoding**: The Ingestion Engine receives the request, validates the source, and transforms the data into a `MemoryFragment`. This includes adding metadata like source, timestamp, and initial semantic tags. The `MemoryFragment` is saved to the Working Memory Store.
3.  **Consolidation**: The Consolidation Daemon periodically scans the WMS. It might find several `MemoryFragment`s related to a single "event" or "concept." It merges these into a new `MemoryTapestry` document, creating links and a narrative context.
4.  **Archiving**: Once a `MemoryTapestry` is created, it is moved from the WMS to the Long-Term Storage.
5.  **Indexing**: As the `MemoryTapestry` is written to the LTS, the Indexing Engine immediately processes its content and updates the relevant search indexes.
6.  **Retrieval**: An external node (e.g., Hakim) sends a `MEMORY_QUERY_REQUEST` KLF message. The Query Engine parses this, uses the indexes to find relevant `MemoryTapestry` documents in the LTS, and returns the results to the requesting node.
