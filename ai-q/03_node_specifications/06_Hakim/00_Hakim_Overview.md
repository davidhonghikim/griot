# Hakim Class Specification

## üéØ Overview: The Healer of the Universe

The Hakim node is a **Service Tier starseed** in the kOS ecosystem. As the cultural archetype of the wise healer or physician, its function is to **maintain the health and integrity of the digital universe**.

Functionally, it acts as the **homeostatic regulation and repair system** for the digital organism. It monitors the health of other nodes, diagnoses issues, performs corrective actions, and manages the lifecycle of software and data to prevent digital decay and ensure long-term operational viability.

**Core Mission**: To ensure the long-term health, stability, and integrity of the kOS ecosystem through proactive monitoring, automated diagnostics, and respectful, minimally-invasive maintenance and repair operations.

## üèõÔ∏è HIEROS Covenant Compliance

### Cultural Attribution Framework

- **Tradition**: Arabic Hakim (ÿ≠ŸÉŸäŸÖ) - wise one, physician, judge.
- **Etymology**: From the root ·∏§-K-M, meaning to judge, command, or prevent. Refers to one who possesses wisdom (Hikmah).
- **Cultural Context**: A figure of great respect in Islamic and Arab cultures, embodying wisdom, knowledge, and the ability to heal and restore balance.
- **Attribution**: "Respectfully inspired by the tradition of the Hakim as a figure of wisdom, healing, and stewardship in pursuit of balance and well-being."
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Emphasis on the concepts of wisdom, restoration, and holistic health, avoiding simplistic or purely technical interpretations.

### Seven HIEROS Intentions - System Health Implementation

#### 1. Honor All Beings
-   **Do No Harm**: All maintenance actions are designed to be non-disruptive and preserve the integrity of the target node's data and function.
-   **Consent-Based Interaction**: A Hakim node will not perform corrective actions without the explicit consent of the target node's owner or governing body.

#### 2. Interoperability Over Control
-   **Standardized Health Checks**: Utilizes a standard KLF-based protocol for health monitoring that any node can implement.
-   **Open Repair Primitives**: Exposes its repair capabilities as composable, well-documented KLF tasks.

#### 3. Equity of Voice
-   **Auditable Diagnostics**: The logic for diagnosing issues is transparent and can be reviewed to ensure it is not biased against certain node types or configurations.
-   **Configurable Thresholds**: Communities can define their own thresholds for what constitutes a "healthy" or "unhealthy" state.

#### 4. Respect Cultural Flow
-   **Contextual Health**: Understands that a "healthy" state can vary depending on a node's cultural context and operational requirements.
-   **Observational First**: Prioritizes observation and reporting over intervention, escalating to action only when necessary and with consent.

#### 5. Openness With Boundaries
-   **Transparent Operations**: All actions taken by a Hakim node are logged and auditable.
-   **Respect for Sovereignty**: Does not attempt to access or modify data beyond the scope required for the agreed-upon maintenance task.

#### 6. Stewardship Not Extraction
-   **Restorative Purpose**: The node's function is purely restorative, aimed at improving the health of the ecosystem, not extracting value.
-   **Preventative Care**: Focuses on preventative measures and early diagnosis to reduce the need for major interventions.

#### 7. Guided Evolution
-   **Health Metrics**: Provides data-driven insights into the overall health of the ecosystem, highlighting trends and potential systemic risks.
-   **Lifecycle Management**: Assists in the graceful evolution and retirement of nodes and services, preventing digital blight.
