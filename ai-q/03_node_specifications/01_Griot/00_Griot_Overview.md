# Griot Class Specification: The Primal Starseed

## üéØ Overview: The Genesis Point

The Griot node is the **Primal Starseed** of the kOS ecosystem. Inspired by the cultural archetype of the West African storyteller, its function is to carry and transmit the "story" or "song" of the entire system. It acts as the **zygote**, or **seed cell**, for the digital organism.

Its core purpose is to provide a generic, robust framework for **bootstrapping and managing the lifecycle of other kOS nodes**. It is the genesis point from which all other specialized functions in the ecosystem emerge.

It accomplishes this through two primary, universal services:
-   **Replication Service:** A generic packaging and distribution framework. It takes a node's specification and dependencies and packages them into a verifiable, distributable artifact. This is inspired by the Griot's role as a preserver and transmitter of essential stories.
-   **Differentiation Service:** A generic installation and bootstrapping framework. It guides a new, unformed node through the process of expressing a specific part of its "genome" (configuration) to become a specialized node like a `Tohunga` or `Musa`.

## üèõÔ∏è HIEROS Covenant Compliance

### Cultural Attribution Framework
-   **Tradition**: West African Griot (jeli or jali) - oral historians, storytellers, praise singers, poets, and/or musicians.
-   **Etymology**: From French "griot," likely from Portuguese "criado" (servant). The term "jeli" in the Mande languages is more authentic.
-   **Cultural Context**: Griots are custodians of oral tradition and history. They are living archives of a community's genealogy, historical events, and social customs. Their role is not just to preserve, but to perform and transmit this knowledge, often through song and story.
-   **Permission Status**: This framework is a placeholder for future community consultation.
-   **Attribution**: Respectfully inspired by the Griot tradition of knowledge preservation, oral history, and the transmission of core cultural identity from one generation to the next.

### Seven HIEROS Intentions - Detailed Implementation

#### 1. Honor All Beings
-   The Griot's packaging service ensures that the identity and authorship of the original node creator are preserved and cryptographically signed within any distributed artifact.

#### 2. Interoperability Over Control
-   The entire framework is built on open standards. The package format is a simple, well-documented `tar.gz` with a `manifest.json`, not a proprietary format.

#### 3. Equity of Voice
-   The Griot node provides its services to any and all nodes that verifiably adhere to the HIEROS codex, without prejudice to their function or origin.

#### 4. Respect Data Flow
-   The Griot does not inspect or alter the content of the nodes it packages, respecting the integrity of their data. It only adds metadata required for distribution and verification.

#### 5. Openness With Boundaries
-   The packaging and installation processes are transparent and auditable. Logs are kept for every action. However, the Griot will refuse to package or install a node that does not have a valid HIEROS signature, enforcing a critical boundary.

#### 6. Stewardship Not Extraction
-   The Griot acts as a steward for the ecosystem's "genetic code." It exists to serve and replicate other nodes, not to extract value from them. It uses a secure, P2P distribution model (e.g., BitTorrent) to minimize its own resource footprint.

#### 7. Guided Evolution
-   By managing the distribution of new node versions, the Griot facilitates the guided, orderly evolution of the entire ecosystem. It ensures that updates are distributed safely and can be rolled back if necessary.
