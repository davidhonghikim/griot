# Griot Node Specification: The Primal Starseed

## üéØ Overview: The Genesis Point

The Griot node is the **Primal Starseed** of the kOS ecosystem. Inspired by the cultural archetype of the West African storyteller, its function is to carry and transmit the "story" or "song" of the entire system. It acts as the **zygote**, or **seed cell**, for the digital organism.

Its core purpose is to provide a generic, robust framework for **bootstrapping and managing the lifecycle of other kOS nodes**. It is the genesis point from which all other specialized functions in the ecosystem emerge.

It accomplishes this through two primary, universal services:
-   **Replication Service:** A generic packaging and distribution framework. It takes a node's specification and dependencies and packages them into a verifiable, distributable artifact. This is inspired by the Griot's role as a preserver and transmitter of essential stories.
-   **Differentiation Service:** A generic installation and bootstrapping framework. It guides a new, unformed node through the process of expressing a specific part of its "genome" (configuration) to become a specialized node like a `Tohunga` or `Musa`.

## üèõÔ∏è HIEROS Covenant Compliance

### Cultural Attribution Framework
-   **Tradition**: West African Griot (jeli or jali) - oral historians, storytellers, praise singers, poets, and/or musicians.
-   **Etymology**: From French "griot," likely from Portuguese "criado" (servant). The term "jeli" in the Mande languages is more authentic.
-   **Cultural Context**: Griots are custodians of oral tradition and history. They are living archives of a community's genealogy, historical events, and social customs. Their role is not just to preserve, but to perform and transmit this knowledge, often through song and story.
-   **Permission Status**: This framework is a placeholder for future community consultation.
-   **Attribution**: Respectfully inspired by the Griot tradition of knowledge preservation, oral history, and the transmission of core cultural identity from one generation to the next.

### Seven HIEROS Intentions - Detailed Implementation

#### 1. Honor All Beings
-   The Griot's packaging service ensures that the identity and authorship of the original node creator are preserved and cryptographically signed within any distributed artifact.

#### 2. Interoperability Over Control
-   The entire framework is built on open standards. The package format is a simple, well-documented `tar.gz` with a `manifest.json`, not a proprietary format.

#### 3. Equity of Voice
-   The Griot node provides its services to any and all nodes that verifiably adhere to the HIEROS codex, without prejudice to their function or origin.

#### 4. Respect Data Flow
-   The Griot does not inspect or alter the content of the nodes it packages, respecting the integrity of their data. It only adds metadata required for distribution and verification.

#### 5. Openness With Boundaries
-   The packaging and installation processes are transparent and auditable. Logs are kept for every action. However, the Griot will refuse to package or install a node that does not have a valid HIEROS signature, enforcing a critical boundary.

#### 6. Stewardship Not Extraction
-   The Griot acts as a steward for the ecosystem's "genetic code." It exists to serve and replicate other nodes, not to extract value from them. It uses a secure, P2P distribution model (e.g., BitTorrent) to minimize its own resource footprint.

#### 7. Guided Evolution
-   By managing the distribution of new node versions, the Griot facilitates the guided, orderly evolution of the entire ecosystem. It ensures that updates are distributed safely and can be rolled back if necessary.

## 2. Handshake & Replication Protocols

### 2.1. HIEROS Codex Declaration (The Genetic Handshake)

A Griot node's commitment to the HIEROS Codex is declared via a static, signed document. This is the **genetic handshake** that allows for mutual recognition between cells.

- **Process:** During initial growth (installation), the node generates a signature of the hash of the canonical `HIEROS_Codex.md` document. This signature is included in its public identity, proving it shares the same core DNA as all other kOS nodes.

### 2.2. Node Identity Response (Genetic Marker)

```json
{
  "nodeId": "did:kos:griot:a1b2c3d4e5f6",
  "nodeClass": "Griot",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "endpoint": "https://griot.example.com:30437",
  "capabilities": [
    "replication",
    "differentiation",
    "sync",
    "repair"
  ],
  "hierosCodex": {
    "codex_version": "1.0",
    "codex_hash": "sha256:abf28...",
    "signature": "ed25519_signature_of_hash"
  },
  "signature": "ed25519_signature_of_identity_document"
}
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Service Boundaries (Health & Abuse Prevention)

This component acts as a protective boundary, insulating the node from technical abuse. It is a simple, non-judgmental protective layer.
-   **Rate Limiting:** Protects against denial-of-service attacks.
-   **Payload Size Enforcement:** Prevents single large requests from overwhelming the node's resources.

## 4. Data Models

These are the core data structures used by the Griot node's services, defined using a Pydantic-like syntax for clarity.

### 4.1. NodePackage
Represents a distributable, verifiable artifact containing a kOS node's code and metadata.

```json
{
  "package_id": "string (sha256_hash)",
  "manifest": {
    "node_class": "string",
    "version": "string (semver)",
    "author_did": "string (did:kos:...)",
    "dependencies": ["string"],
    "signature": "string (ed25519_signature)"
  },
  "artifact_url": "string (url)",
  "created_at": "string (iso_8601_timestamp)"
}
```

### 4.2. InstallationJob
Represents a task for the Differentiation Service to install a `NodePackage`.

```json
{
  "job_id": "string (uuid)",
  "package_id": "string (sha256_hash)",
  "status": "pending | running | completed | failed",
  "logs": ["string"],
  "created_at": "string (iso_8601_timestamp)"
}
```

## 5. API Specification

## 6. Python Code Examples
### Interacting with the Griot API (Conceptual)

```python
import httpx
import time

# This is a conceptual example of how a client would interact with the Griot API.
# It assumes a running Griot node at the specified base URL.

GRIOT_API_URL = "http://localhost:8003/api/v1"

def run_node_bootstrap_process():
    # 1. Request a new node package to be created from a git repository
    print("Requesting Tohunga node package creation...")
    res = httpx.post(f"{GRIOT_API_URL}/replicate", json={
        "source_url": "https://github.com/kos-community/TohungaNode",
        "version": "1.2.0"
    })
    
    if res.status_code != 202:
        print(f"Error starting packaging job: {res.text}")
        return

    package_info = res.json()
    package_id = package_info["package_id"]
    print(f"Packaging job started for package_id: {package_id}")

    # 2. Start an installation job for the newly created package
    print(f"\\nRequesting installation for package: {package_id}")
    res = httpx.post(f"{GRIOT_API_URL}/differentiate", json={
        "package_id": package_id
    })

    if res.status_code != 202:
        print(f"Error starting installation job: {res.text}")
        return
        
    job_info = res.json()
    job_id = job_info["job_id"]
    print(f"Installation job created with job_id: {job_id}")

    # 3. Poll for the installation job to complete
    print("\\nPolling for job completion...")
    while True:
        res = httpx.get(f"{GRIOT_API_URL}/differentiate/jobs/{job_id}")
        job = res.json()
        
        print(f"  - Job status: {job['status']}")
        
        if job["status"] in ["completed", "failed"]:
            print("\\nFinal logs:")
            for log in job.get("logs", []):
                print(f"  - {log}")
            break
        
        time.sleep(5)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_node_bootstrap_process()
```

## 7. Deployment & Configuration

### 7.1. Configuration
The Griot node is configured via environment variables.

-   `GRIOT_LOG_LEVEL`: The log level for the application (e.g., `INFO`, `DEBUG`).
-   `GRIOT_STATE_DIR`: The local file system path to store state (e.g., job queues, package registry). Defaults to `/var/lib/griot`.
-   `GRIOT_PACKAGE_DIR`: The local file system path to store downloaded node artifacts. Defaults to `/var/cache/griot`.
-   `JWT_SECRET`: The secret key for signing internal JWTs.

### 7.2. Docker Deployment
A Griot node should be deployed as a Docker container for consistency and portability.

**Sample Dockerfile:**
```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy the requirements file into the container
COPY requirements.txt ./

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the application's code into the container
COPY . .

# Make port 8003 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 8003

# Define environment variables
ENV GRIOT_STATE_DIR=/data/state
ENV GRIOT_PACKAGE_DIR=/data/packages

# Create mount points for persistent data
RUN mkdir -p /data/state /data/packages

# Run the application
CMD ["uvicorn", "server.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8003"]
```

### 7.3. Monitoring
The Griot node should expose a `/metrics` endpoint for Prometheus scraping, providing insight into its operations.

-   `griot_replication_jobs_total{status}`: Total number of replication jobs (status: `started`, `completed`, `failed`).
-   `griot_differentiation_jobs_total{status}`: Total number of differentiation jobs (status: `started`, `completed`, `failed`).
-   `griot_packages_stored_total`: Total number of node packages currently stored.
-   `griot_api_requests_total{endpoint}`: Total number of API requests by endpoint.
