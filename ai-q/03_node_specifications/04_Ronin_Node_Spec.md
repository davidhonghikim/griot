# Ronin Node Specification: The Nomadic Starseed

## 🎯 Overview: Charting the Universe

The Ronin node is a **Foundation Tier starseed** in the kOS ecosystem. As the cultural archetype of the Japanese masterless expert, its function is to **autonomously explore the digital universe** and chart the pathways within it.

Functionally, it acts as a **chemoreceptor or exploratory feeler** for the digital organism. It roams the network, "tasting" connections, identifying resources, discovering other nodes, and mapping the ever-changing topology of the ecosystem. It is how the kOS builds its awareness of itself and the universe it inhabits.

**Core Mission**: Serve as the autonomous scouts and pathfinders of the kOS network, discovering new services, mapping capabilities, establishing optimal connection routes, and maintaining network topology awareness while operating with complete independence and cultural sensitivity.

## 🏛️ HIEROS Covenant Compliance

### Cultural Attribution Framework

- **Tradition**: Japanese rōnin (浪人) - "wave person," masterless samurai/expert
- **Etymology**: "rō" (浪, wave) + "nin" (人, person) - one who flows like water, masterless yet skilled
- **Cultural Context**: Historical Japanese warriors/experts who maintained their skills and honor while serving various causes
- **Attribution**: "Respectfully inspired by the Japanese rōnin tradition of independent expertise, self-reliance, and service to the greater good"
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Recognition of both historical complexity and positive aspects of independence and adaptability

### Seven HIEROS Intentions - Implementation Framework

#### 1. Honor All Beings
- **Non-Intrusive Discovery**: Utilizes standard, non-disruptive network protocols for scanning.
- **Respectful Interaction**: Follows `robots.txt`-style policies and service boundaries.

#### 2. Interoperability Over Control
- **Universal Protocol Support**: The framework is capable of discovering services over multiple standard protocols (mDNS, DHT, HTTP).
- **Open Standards**: Provides discovery results in standard, well-documented formats.

#### 3. Equity of Voice
- **Unbiased Discovery**: The discovery mechanism itself is protocol-based and does not favor any service.
- **Auditable Logic**: The discovery methods are transparent, allowing users to verify their fairness.

#### 4. Respect Cultural Flow
- **Contextual Awareness**: Can be configured to operate within specific network contexts or boundaries.
- **Observational Role**: The node's primary role is to observe and report on the network topology, not alter it.

#### 5. Openness With Boundaries
- **Transparent Methods**: The discovery algorithms and methods are open and documented.
- **Respect for Privacy**: Does not attempt to bypass access controls or inspect encrypted data payloads.

#### 6. Stewardship Not Extraction
- **Network Health**: Provides data that helps maintain network stability and awareness.
- **Sustainable Discovery**: Employs efficient scanning techniques to minimize network load.

#### 7. Guided Evolution
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Provides the raw data necessary for higher-level services to analyze network health and evolution.
- **Adaptive Tooling**: The framework can be extended with new discovery modules as network protocols evolve.

## 📡 API Specification Framework

### Architectural Design Note
> In alignment with the **"Framework, Not Application"** principle, this API is job-based. Clients submit a discovery job with parameters, and the Ronin node executes it asynchronously. This is more abstract and primitive-based than providing specific scan/map commands.

### Asynchronous Job-Based API

#### `POST /jobs/discovery`
-   **Summary**: Creates and starts a new asynchronous discovery job.
-   **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "type": "discovery",
      "params": {
        "target": {
          "type": "network_cidr", // or "domain", "did"
          "value": "192.168.1.0/24"
        },
        "protocols": ["mdns", "http-api"],
        "depth": 1
      }
    }
    ```
-   **Response**: `202 Accepted` with the `DiscoveryJob` object.

#### `GET /jobs/discovery/{job_id}`
-   **Summary**: Retrieves the status and results of a discovery job.
-   **Response**: `200 OK` with the `DiscoveryJob` object. A `completed` job will contain the results.

## 4. Data Models

### 4.1. DiscoveryJob
```json
{
  "job_id": "string (uuid)",
  "status": "pending | running | completed | failed",
  "params": { "... from request ..." },
