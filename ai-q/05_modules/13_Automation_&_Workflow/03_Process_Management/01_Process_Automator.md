# **Process Automator**

## **Overview**

The Process Automator module provides intelligent process automation capabilities, enabling the automation of complex business processes, workflows, and operational tasks. It combines AI-driven decision making, adaptive execution, and intelligent process optimization to streamline operations and improve efficiency.

## **Core Principles**
- **Intelligent Automation**: Use AI/ML to automate complex decision-making processes.
- **Adaptive Execution**: Adapt process execution based on changing conditions and requirements.
- **Process Optimization**: Continuously optimize processes for efficiency and effectiveness.
- **Business Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with existing business systems and workflows.

## **Function Specifications**

### **Core Functions**
- **Process Definition**: Define and model complex business processes.
- **AI-Driven Decision Making**: Use AI/ML for intelligent decision making within processes.
- **Adaptive Execution**: Adapt process execution based on real-time conditions.
- **Process Optimization**: Optimize processes for efficiency and effectiveness.
- **Business Integration**: Integrate with existing business systems and APIs.
- **Process Monitoring**: Monitor process execution and performance.

### **TypeScript Interfaces**
```typescript
interface ProcessAutomatorConfig {
  aiEngine: AIEngineConfig;
  adaptiveExecution: AdaptiveConfig;
  optimizationPolicy: OptimizationPolicy;
  businessIntegration: IntegrationConfig;
}

interface Process {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  definition: ProcessDefinition;
  aiDecisions: AIDecision[];
  adaptiveRules: AdaptiveRule[];
  businessRules: BusinessRule[];
  performance: PerformanceMetrics;
}

interface ProcessDefinition {
  steps: ProcessStep[];

  errorHandling: ErrorHandling;
}

interface AIDecision {
  id: string;
  type: DecisionType;
  model: AIModel;
  confidence: number;
  fallback: FallbackAction;
}

function defineProcess(definition: ProcessDefinition): Promise<Process>
