# **Business Process Manager**

## **Overview**

The Business Process Manager module provides comprehensive business process management capabilities, including process modeling, execution, monitoring, and optimization. It supports BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation), business rule integration, and advanced process analytics to streamline business operations and improve efficiency.

## **Core Principles**
- **Process Modeling**: Model business processes using standard BPMN notation.
- **Business Rule Integration**: Integrate business rules and policies into process execution.
- **Process Analytics**: Provide comprehensive analytics and insights for process optimization.
- **Compliance Management**: Ensure process compliance with business policies and regulations.

## **Function Specifications**

### **Core Functions**
- **Process Modeling**: Create and manage business process models using BPMN.
- **Process Execution**: Execute business processes with rule-based decision making.
- **Business Rule Management**: Manage and integrate business rules into processes.
- **Process Analytics**: Provide analytics and insights for process optimization.
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Monitor process compliance with business policies.
- **Process Optimization**: Optimize processes based on analytics and performance data.

### **TypeScript Interfaces**
```typescript
interface BusinessProcessManagerConfig {
  bpmnEngine: BPMNEngineConfig;
  businessRules: BusinessRuleConfig;
  analytics: AnalyticsConfig;
  compliance: ComplianceConfig;
}

interface BusinessProcess {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  bpmnDefinition: BPMNDefinition;
  businessRules: BusinessRule[];
  performance: PerformanceMetrics;
  compliance: ComplianceStatus;
}

interface BPMNDefinition {
  processId: string;
  activities: Activity[];
  gateways: Gateway[];
  events: Event[];
  flows: Flow[];
  lanes: Lane[];
}

interface BusinessRule {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  condition: RuleCondition;
  action: RuleAction;
  priority: number;
  enabled: boolean;
}

function modelProcess(bpmnDefinition: BPMNDefinition): Promise<BusinessProcess>
function executeProcess(processId: string, data: any): Promise<ExecutionResult>
function manageBusinessRule(rule: BusinessRule): Promise<RuleResult>
function analyzeProcess(processId: string): Promise<AnalyticsResult>
function monitorCompliance(processId: string): Promise<ComplianceResult>
function optimizeProcess(processId: string): Promise<OptimizationResult>
```

      bpmn_file: "order_to_cash.bpmn"
      business_rules:
        - rule: "credit_check"
          condition: "order_amount > 10000"
          action: "require_approval"
        - rule: "inventory_check"
          condition: "item_available == false"
          action: "backorder_process"
      compliance_rules:
        - rule: "sox_approval"
          condition: "transaction_amount > 50000"
          action: "require_dual_approval"
      analytics:
        kpis:
          - "cycle_time"
          - "error_rate"
