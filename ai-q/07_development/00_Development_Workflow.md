# AI-Q Development Workflow Guide

**Standardized Process for Granular Specification Development**

> **üìã Required Reading**: All agents must review [File Size and Modularization Guide](02_File_Size_and_Modularization_Guide.md) before beginning development work to ensure optimal token usage and context window efficiency.

## üéØ Development Philosophy

### **Core Principles**
- **Graduate Thesis Quality**: Academic rigor with comprehensive research and documentation
- **Cultural Sensitivity First**: Respectful attribution and community engagement in all work
- **HIEROS Compliance**: Seven Intentions integration as fundamental requirement
- **Production Excellence**: Real-world deployment readiness for all specifications
- **Recursive Perfection**: 2-3 parallel development with thorough review cycles

### **Quality Over Speed**
- **Methodical Research**: Thorough cultural and technical investigation
- **Community Engagement**: Genuine relationships with cultural advisors - FUTURE IMPLEMENTATIOM
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: 600-1000+ lines per major specification divided into modules in sub-directories as needed to avoid monolithic files
- **Production Readiness**: Complete deployment, monitoring, and operational guidance
- **Peer Review Standards**: Academic-level validation and verification

### **Phase 3: Implementation Guidance** (20% of effort)

#### **Deployment and Operations**
1. **Multi-Tier Deployment Strategies**
   - Individual/Research: Single researcher or small team usage
   - Department/Institution: Medium-scale organizational deployment
   - Enterprise/Global: Large-scale, high-availability implementations

2. **Technology Stack Integration**
   - Docker containerization with cultural compliance
   - Kubernetes orchestration with community oversight
