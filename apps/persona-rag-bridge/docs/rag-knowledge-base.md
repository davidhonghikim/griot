# RAG Knowledge Base: Feature Analysis & System Requirements

## Document Type: System Analysis
## Category: Architecture & Planning
## Tags: feature-analysis, kai-cd, open-webui, target-system, requirements

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the current state of the kai-cd browser extension compared to Open-WebUI, and defines the target system requirements for creating an "Open-WebUI+" (OWU+) extension.

## Key Findings

### Critical Issues in kai-cd
1. **Service Health/Status**: Broken and unreliable status checks
2. **Service Sync**: Buggy persona synchronization
3. **Performance**: Slow image gallery refresh
4. **Error Handling**: Poor error feedback and unclear messages
5. **Persistence**: Theme settings not persisted

### Open-WebUI Strengths
1. **Multi-model Support**: Full support for Ollama, OpenAI, and other providers
2. **Advanced RAG**: Built-in document library and RAG engine
3. **Media Generation**: Comprehensive image/video/audio generation
4. **User Experience**: Full responsive design, PWA support, accessibility
5. **Security**: Advanced vault and RBAC system

### Target System: OWU+ Requirements

#### Core Features (High Priority)
- Multi-model chat with persona switching
- RAG and knowledge management
- Media generation and gallery
- Security and vault improvements
- Real-time status and notifications
- Responsive design and PWA

#### Unique Features (Critical)
- KLF (Kind Link Framework) protocol integration
- Artefact management system
- Service orchestration
- Custom quick UI for ComfyUI and A1111
- Diceware passphrase generator
- Recipe box and skills
- Quick load for custom agents

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes
1. Fix kai-cd's broken service health/status system
2. Implement KLF protocol integration
3. Create artefact management system
4. Improve service orchestration

### Phase 2: Core Features
1. Port and modernize kai-cd components
2. Add Open-WebUI's advanced features
3. Implement multi-model chat
4. Add RAG and knowledge management

### Phase 3: Unique Features
1. Create custom quick UI for AI services
2. Implement diceware passphrase generator
3. Build recipe box and skills system
4. Add quick load for custom agents

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture
- Browser extension with popup and panel modes
- Tab â†” Panel state transfer capability
- KLF protocol backend integration
- RAG system for knowledge management
- Artefact storage and management

### Technology Stack
- React with TypeScript
- Jotai for state management
- Vite for build system
- Monorepo structure with npm workspaces
- Shared RAG package for backend integration

### Security Requirements
- Credential vault with encryption
- RBAC and permissions system
- Secure plugin sandboxing
- Security monitoring and alerts

## Success Metrics

1. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for service status checks
2. **Performance**: <2s response time for UI interactions
3. **Usability**: Intuitive interface matching Open-WebUI quality
4. **Security**: Zero credential exposure
5. **Extensibility**: Plugin system for custom integrations

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- KLF protocol complexity
- Artefact management scalability
- Service orchestration reliability

### Medium Risk
- Performance with large media galleries
- Multi-model chat synchronization
- RAG system accuracy

### Low Risk
- UI/UX implementation
- Basic feature porting
- Documentation and testing

## Next Steps

1. Scaffold new extension structure
2. Implement critical fixes first
3. Build on kai-cd's working foundation
4. Add Open-WebUI's advanced features
5. Create unique OWU+ features
