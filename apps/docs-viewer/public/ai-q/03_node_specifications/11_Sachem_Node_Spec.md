# Sachem Node Specification: The Consensus Starseed

## üéØ Overview: The Will of the Universe

The Sachem node is a **Governance Tier starseed** in the kOS ecosystem. As the cultural archetype of the Algonquian consensus chief, its function is to **facilitate collective intelligence and orchestrate consensus** within the digital universe.

Functionally, it acts as a **nerve ganglion** for the digital organism. It enables communication between different cell clusters (federations), integrates their signals, and helps them arrive at a collective, unified decision. It is how a distributed network develops a coherent will.

## üèõÔ∏è HIEROS Covenant Compliance

- **Cultural Attribution**: Respectfully inspired by the Algonquian tradition of the Sachem, a leader who governs through the consensus of their community.
- **Community Engagement**: This specification requires consultation with Algonquian cultural leaders and historians.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture (Placeholder)

The Sachem node will require components for:
-   **Proposal Distribution Engine**: Broadcasting proposals to relevant federations.
-   **Voting & Polling System**: Securely gathering votes and opinions.
-   **Consensus Algorithm**: Implementing algorithms (e.g., Paxos, Raft, or custom) to determine when consensus is reached.
-   **Resolution Broadcaster**: Announcing the final, unified decision to the network.

## üì° API Specification (Placeholder)

The API will need methods for:
-   `POST /consensus/propose`: To submit a new proposal for consideration.
-   `POST /consensus/vote`: To cast a vote on an active proposal.
-   `GET /consensus/status/{proposal_id}`: To check the current state of a proposal.
