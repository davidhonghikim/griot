# Execution Plan: kOS Bootstrap & Protocol Formalization

**Status**: `Complete`
**Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Synthesize & Formalize Core Architecture
**Lead Agent**: Gemini 2.5 Pro
**Last Update**: 2025-06-24

---

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this execution plan is to establish a solid, well-documented foundation for the `kOS` ecosystem. This involves synthesizing the visionary concepts from the `documentation/brainstorm` directory into a set of canonical, actionable architectural documents. This plan will serve as the single source of truth for bootstrapping the development of the `Griot` seed node and the core `kOS` protocols.

## 2. Mandatory Workflow Compliance

This plan and all subsequent actions will adhere strictly to the `documentation/01_agents/01_core/agent-rules.md`. All work will be logged, changes will be made in small, verifiable steps, and the "Two-Edit Rule" (suspended for docs) and "Temp File Swap" methods will be followed.

## Phase 1: Synthesize & Formalize Core Architecture

*   **Objective**: Distill the critical concepts from the `brainstorm` directories into official, canonical documents.
*   **Status**: `Complete`

| **1.0** | **Create Execution Plan**                                                                                                               | 游릴      | Gemini 2.5 Pro | Plan created to align with mandatory agent workflow.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **1.1** | **Formalize Node Classes**<br/>Synthesize the 13 role definitions from `brainstorm/deploy/roles` into a single, canonical document. | 游릴      | Gemini 2.5 Pro | Synthesized 13 role definitions into `04_kOS_Node_Classes.md`. Performed a full re-verification against source files after a data-loss incident; the document is now confirmed to be complete and accurate.                       |
| **1.2** | **Analyze Core Protocols**<br/>Read and summarize the key documents in `06_future/protocols`.                                           | 游릴      | Gemini 2.5 Pro | Analyzed KLP and Agent Communication specs. Confirmed `kOS` uses a sophisticated, decentralized, DID-based architecture.                                                                                                           |
| **1.3** | **Refine & Standardize Core Docs**<br/>Create canonical docs for protocols and node classes, ensuring they conform to all documentation system standards. | 游릴      | Gemini 2.5 Pro | Created `01_Griot_Seed_Protocol.md` and `04_kOS_Node_Classes.md`. Both files were corrected and re-verified for completeness and accuracy after an initial data-loss error. Conformance to standards is confirmed.          |
| **1.4** | **Resolve Project Directory Naming**<br/>Propose and execute the renaming of the `/griot_ai-q` directory.           | 游릴      | Gemini 2.5 Pro      | Renamed `/griot_ai-q` directory to `/griot-node` to align project structure with architectural understanding.                                                                                                                           |
| **1.5** | **Update SDK**<br/>Update the TypeScript SDK to reflect the refined `Griot_Seed_Protocol_V1`.                                               | 游릴      | Gemini 2.5 Pro      | Renamed SDK to `GriotSeedClient.ts`, added all methods (`identity`, `jobs`, `proxy`), and synchronized it across both the `kai-cd` and `griot-node` projects. All `TODO`s resolved. |

## Phase 2: Backend & SDK Implementation (Pending)

*   **Objective**: Build the `Griot` node and a compliant SDK.
*   **Status**: `Ready` (Pending user go-ahead)

---

## Phase 3: Frontend Client Migration (Pending)

*   **Objective**: Refactor the `kai-cd` extension to be a client of the `Griot` node.
*   **Status**: `Blocked` (Pending Phase 2 completion)
