# Handoff: Start of Phase 2

**To the next agent:**

This document provides the necessary context to begin **Phase 2: Backend & SDK Implementation** of the `kOS` bootstrap. My primary goal during Phase 1 was to formalize the project's foundational architecture from brainstormed concepts into canonical documents and a client-side SDK.

**Assume I have made errors.** My operational history includes critical mistakes, such as file truncation errors. A core part of your initial work should be a skeptical and thorough review of the documents and code I have produced.

---

## 1. Current Project Status

**Phase 1 is complete.** The following high-level objectives were accomplished:

1.  **Architectural Formalization:** Core concepts from the `brainstorm` directory were analyzed and synthesized into two canonical documents defining the `kOS` node classes and the client-facing `Griot Seed Protocol`.
2.  **SDK Development:** A complete TypeScript SDK (`GriotSeedClient.ts`) for the protocol was developed, with all `TODOs` resolved.
3.  **Project Synchronization:** The protocol documents and SDK have been mirrored across the two relevant project directories: `kai-cd` (the client) and `griot-node` (the server).
4.  **Directory Renaming:** The server project directory was renamed from `griot_ai-q` to `griot-node` to better reflect its purpose.

## 2. Mandatory Documents for Your Review

You must read and fully understand these documents before taking any action.

1.  **`documentation/01_agents/01_core/agent-rules.md`**: This is your primary directive. My own errors were a direct result of failing to perfectly adhere to these rules. Pay special attention to the "Temp File Swap" method for file editing.
2.  **`documentation/01_agents/02_planning/Execution_Plan_kOS_Bootstrap.md.tmp`**: This is the full log of my work. Review my steps to understand the context and evolution of the current state.
3.  **`documentation/future/protocols/01_Griot_Seed_Protocol.md`**: This is the canonical definition of the REST API you are about to build. Your server implementation must match this specification *exactly*.
4.  **`griot-node/sdk/GriotSeedClient.ts`**: This is the client SDK. Your server must correctly handle requests from this client.

---

## 3. Critical Analysis & Potential Errors (Review This Carefully)

Here is my own critical review of the work I completed. These are areas where you should focus your initial analysis.

*   **File Integrity:** My most significant error was **data loss via file truncation** when using the `edit_file` tool.
    *   **Your Action:** Before you begin, you should manually verify the contents of `01_Griot_Seed_Protocol.md` and `04_kOS_Node_Classes.md` against their source material in the `brainstorm` directory. Do not trust that my restoration of them was perfect.

*   **SDK-Protocol Consistency:** I have implemented the SDK to match the protocol, but there may be subtle inconsistencies.
    *   **Proxy Endpoint Ambiguity:** The protocol defines the proxy endpoint as `POST /proxy/{serviceId}/{...}`. I implemented this in the SDK with a `path` parameter. The backend implementation will need to robustly parse this variable path structure.
    *   **Error Handling:** The SDK's `_fetch` method has basic error handling. The backend server must return errors that conform *exactly* to the `ApiError` interface defined in the SDK and the protocol, or the client will fail to parse them correctly.
    *   **Your Action:** Trace the logic for each method in `GriotSeedClient.ts` and verify that it aligns perfectly with the endpoints in `01_Griot_Seed_Protocol.md`. Check for any mismatch in types, paths, or HTTP methods.

*   **Execution Plan State:** The execution plan file still has a `.tmp` extension. This should be corrected.

## 4. Next Objective: Phase 2 - Build the Griot Node

Your primary objective is to **build the Griot node server**.

1.  **Choose a Tech Stack:** The protocol is language-agnostic. The `griot-node` directory contains a `gateway/main.py` file, suggesting a Python/FastAPI stack might be intended, but you should verify this.
2.  **Implement All Endpoints:** Create a web server that implements every endpoint defined in `01_Griot_Seed_Protocol.md`.
3.  **Test Against the SDK:** Use the `GriotSeedClient.ts` as your first client to test your server implementation. If the SDK can successfully call every endpoint on your server, you have a strong baseline for success.

I have completed my work. I am now handing off the project to you. Good luck.
