# Tag System Architecture

## Overview

The tag system provides hierarchical organization and metadata management for recipes, skills, and personas. It enables efficient discovery, filtering, and composition of AI agent capabilities.

## Tag Structure

### Primary Categories
- **compliance** - Code quality, security, and standards compliance
- **security** - Security analysis, threat detection, and protection
- **development** - Code development, refactoring, and architecture
- **testing** - Test creation, validation, and quality assurance
- **deployment** - Infrastructure, configuration, and deployment
- **maintenance** - Monitoring, updates, and system health
- **ai** - AI/ML operations, model management, and intelligence
- **data** - Data processing, storage, and analytics
- **communication** - API design, documentation, and messaging

### Secondary Tags (Subcategories)

#### Compliance Tags
- `compliance:security` - Security compliance checks
- `compliance:code-style` - Code style and formatting
- `compliance:documentation` - Documentation standards
- `compliance:testing` - Testing requirements
- `compliance:environment` - Environment configuration
- `compliance:packages` - Package usage and dependencies

#### Security Tags
- `security:input-validation` - Input sanitization and validation
- `security:injection-prevention` - SQL, XSS, command injection
- `security:authentication` - Auth patterns and validation
- `security:authorization` - Access control and permissions
- `security:secrets` - Secrets management and protection
- `security:encryption` - Cryptographic operations
- `security:threat-detection` - Threat intelligence and analysis

#### Development Tags
- `development:refactoring` - Code refactoring and restructuring

#### Testing Tags
- `testing:unit` - Unit testing and coverage
- `testing:integration` - Integration testing
- `testing:e2e` - End-to-end testing

- `node:skald` - Skald storytelling node capabilities
- `node:amauta` - Amauta teaching node capabilities
- `node:mzee` - Mzee elder node capabilities

### Priority Tags
- `priority:critical` - Critical issues requiring immediate attention
- `priority:high` - High priority items
- `priority:medium` - Medium priority items
- `priority:low` - Low priority items

### Complexity Tags
- `complexity:simple` - Simple operations

## Tag Metadata Schema

```yaml
tags:
  primary: "compliance"
  secondary: ["security", "code-style"]
  nodes: ["musa"]
  priority: "high"
  complexity: "moderate"
  cultural: ["hieros"]
  dependencies: ["security:input-validation"]
  conflicts: ["development:quick-fix"]
  version: "1.0.0"
  created: "2025-01-28"
  updated: "2025-01-28"
  author: "system"
```

## Tag Manager Implementation

The tag manager provides:
- **Tag Discovery**: Find items by tags
- **Tag Composition**: Combine tags for complex queries
- **Tag Validation**: Ensure tag consistency
- **Tag Analytics**: Usage patterns and trends
- **Tag Recommendations**: Suggest relevant tags

## Usage Examples

### Finding Security Skills
```yaml
query:
  type: "skill"
  tags:
    primary: "security"
    secondary: ["input-validation", "injection-prevention"]
    nodes: ["musa"]
```

### Finding Compliance Recipes
```yaml
query:
  type: "recipe"
  tags:
    primary: "compliance"
    priority: "critical"
    complexity: "moderate"
```

### Finding Musa Personas
```yaml
query:
  type: "persona"
  tags:
    nodes: ["musa"]
    cultural: ["hieros"]
    priority: "high"
```
