### Notes:
```
AI-Q Phase 3 Implementation - Quality Standardization Progress

COMPLETED WORK:
- Honest project assessment created (correcting inflated claims)
- Execution plan for 12-week implementation
- Hakim Node expanded: 491â†’856 lines (+365 lines)
- Skald Node expanded: 647â†’887 lines (+240 lines)
- Production framework documentation complete

CURRENT STATUS:
- 4/8 nodes exceed 700+ line standard
- 4/8 nodes need minor expansion (14-77 lines each)
- Total documentation: 6,454 lines (+605 lines, +10.4% growth)
- Production infrastructure framework ready

CRITICAL CORRECTION NEEDED:
- Cultural aspects incorrectly implemented as product features
- Should be generic functionality with cultural naming/inspiration only
- Need to revise Hakim/Skald nodes to remove cultural-specific APIs
- Cultural elements should be naming/symbolic, not functional output

NEXT STEPS:
- Revise expanded nodes to generic functionality
- Complete remaining node expansions with correct approach
- Deploy Foundation Tier to production
- Implement monitoring and CI/CD pipelines
