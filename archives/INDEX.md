AI-Q Phase 3 Implementation - Quality Standardization Progress

COMPLETED WORK:
- Honest project assessment created (correcting inflated claims)
- Execution plan for 12-week implementation
- Hakim Node expanded: 491â†’856 lines (+365 lines)
- Skald Node expanded: 647â†’887 lines (+240 lines)
- Production framework documentation complete

CURRENT STATUS:
- 4/8 nodes exceed 700+ line standard
- 4/8 nodes need minor expansion (14-77 lines each)
- Total documentation: 6,454 lines (+605 lines, +10.4% growth)
- Production infrastructure framework ready

CRITICAL CORRECTION NEEDED:
- Cultural aspects incorrectly implemented as product features
- Should be generic functionality with cultural naming/inspiration only
- Need to revise Hakim/Skald nodes to remove cultural-specific APIs
- Cultural elements should be naming/symbolic, not functional output

NEXT STEPS:
- Revise expanded nodes to generic functionality
- Complete remaining node expansions with correct approach
- Deploy Foundation Tier to production
- Implement monitoring and CI/CD pipelines

feat(docs): Complete Engineering Specifications for Core Nodes

This commit marks the successful completion of the blueprinting phase. All core node classes now have a complete, consistent, and buildable set of engineering specifications.

- Transformed 7 high-level node concepts into 35+ granular documents.
- Each node now has a 5-part spec: Overview, Architecture, Data Models, KLF API, and Database Schema.
- Conducted a full review, identifying and correcting critical inconsistencies and omissions, including a missing Griot API and mismatches with KLF protocol types.
- Updated all handoff documentation (README, FINAL_HANDOFF) to reflect the new project state and the authoritative nature of the new specifications.
- The project is now fully prepared for the implementation phase.

feat(agents): Refactor agent workflow and system prompt

This commit refactors the entire agent workflow to be more robust, streamlined, and philosophically grounded.

- Cleans up legacy files in the 'agents' directory.
- Creates a new, definitive '02_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md' with a detailed agent persona and rules.
- Integrates the HIEROS philosophy as a concrete, actionable code of conduct for the agent.
- Updates the '00_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md' to enforce a new, more comprehensive bootstrapping process for all agents.
