# Skald Module Specification: Output Artifact Storage and Delivery Layer (OASDL)

## Module Name
**Skald Output Artifact Storage and Delivery Layer (OASDL)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Skald Output Artifact Storage and Delivery Layer (OASDL) manages the durable storage, indexing, and controlled delivery of all final output artifacts generated by Skald workflows. This includes narratives, summaries, datasets, media files, and any other workflow-produced deliverables.

## Purpose
To securely and efficiently store all Skald output artifacts, provide controlled delivery mechanisms (API, streaming, batch export), support retrieval and tracking, and enforce retention and data governance policies.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Artifact Storage
- **Multi-Format Support:** Store text, JSON, XML, CSV, images, audio, video, and binary payloads.
- **Artifact Metadata Catalog:** Maintain searchable metadata for each artifact (workflow ID, type, timestamp, user, tags).
- **Content Addressable Storage:** Support deduplication using content hashes.

### 2. Delivery Interfaces
- **API Delivery:** Provide REST and WebSocket APIs for on-demand artifact retrieval.
- **Streaming Delivery:** Support real-time streaming delivery for large or time-sensitive outputs.
- **Batch Export:** Allow bulk artifact exports for offline use or external analytics pipelines.
- **Third-Party Delivery Hooks:** Integrate with external storage (e.g., S3, GCS) for artifact handoff.

### 3. Access Control and Auditability
- **Artifact-Level Access Policies:** Enforce user and tenant-specific delivery permissions.
- **Download Tracking:** Record who accessed each artifact and when.
- **Audit Logs:** Log all artifact storage and retrieval actions in ALC.

### 4. Performance and Scaling
- **High Throughput:** Support parallel artifact writes and reads.
- **Caching Layer:** Implement caching for frequently accessed artifacts.
- **Compression and Chunking:** Optimize large artifact storage and delivery performance.

### 5. Retention and Lifecycle Management
- **Retention Policies:** Support time-based or size-based artifact purging.
- **Archival Tiering:** Move older artifacts to low-cost cold storage.
- **Deletion Protection:** Optional soft-delete and retention hold features.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Latency:** Sub-100ms retrieval time for typical artifact sizes (<1MB).
- **Scalability:** Support millions of stored artifacts.
- **Reliability:** Zero artifact loss with built-in storage redundancy.
- **Extensibility:** Support pluggable storage backends (local, cloud, distributed file systems).

## Data Flow Diagram (Textual)
1. **Workflow Output Generation → OASDL Storage Writer → Artifact Storage Backend → Metadata Catalog Update → Delivery API / Streaming Endpoint / Batch Export Tool**

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** Workflow Orchestrator (SWO), Workflow Output Quality Engine (WOQEE), Admin Control Panel (ACP).
- **Output Interfaces:** Admin Dashboards (DVL), External Delivery Systems, API Consumers, Audit Logging (ALC).

## Configuration Options
- **Storage Backend Type:** Local / Cloud / Hybrid.
- **Artifact Access Policies:** Per workflow type or user role.
- **Retention Duration:** Per artifact type.
- **Compression Settings:** None / Standard / High.

## Example Use Cases
- Delivering a narrative text file to a requesting user via API.
- Streaming large media outputs to a partner application.
- Exporting a batch of artifacts for offline analysis.
- Enforcing retention policies on old generated summaries.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **Custom Delivery Plugins:** For non-standard delivery mechanisms.
- **External Storage Broker Integration:** Allow artifact mirroring to third-party platforms.
- **Dynamic Access Policy Loader:** Support real-time access policy updates.

## Testing and Validation Plan
- Artifact save/retrieve consistency tests.
- Access control enforcement validation.
- Delivery latency benchmarking.
- Retention policy compliance tests.

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **Workflow Orchestrator (SWO)**
- **Workflow Output Quality Evaluation Engine (WOQEE)**
- **Audit Logging and Compliance Engine (ALC)**
- **Admin Control Panel (ACP)**

## Future Enhancements
- AI-driven artifact usage recommendation engine.
- User download behavior analytics.
- External content delivery network (CDN) integration.
- Data usage metering for billing systems.
