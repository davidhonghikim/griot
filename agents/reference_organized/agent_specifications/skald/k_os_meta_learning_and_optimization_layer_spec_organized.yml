# kOS Meta-Learning and Optimization Layer Specification

## Overview

The **Meta-Learning and Optimization Layer** is the self-improving intelligence core of kOS. It continuously observes system behavior, execution outcomes, user feedback, and agent performance to optimize future task execution, skill selection, service routing, and agent behavior.

This layer enables kOS to **evolve dynamically over time**, improving accuracy, reducing latency, minimizing costs, and enhancing user satisfaction—without requiring manual reprogramming.

## Core Responsibilities

| Responsibility | Description |
|---|---|
| **Performance Tracking** | Monitor execution times, error rates, agent reliability, and API/service latency across all skills, recipes, and adapters. |
| **User Feedback Capture** | Record direct user feedback (thumbs up/down, ratings, manual corrections) on outputs and system behavior. |
| **Recipe and Skill Effectiveness Analysis** | Score recipes and skills based on success rates, user satisfaction, and resource cost. |
| **Service Routing Optimization** | Dynamically select which API, LLM, or tool to use for each skill based on historical performance and cost. |
| **Failure Mode Analysis** | Track failure patterns and suggest alternative workflows, fallback recipes, or agent retraining. |
| **Self-Tuning Execution Parameters** | Adjust recipe execution parameters (temperature, token limits, chunk sizes) over time based on performance. |
| **Learning From User Behavior** | Observe how users correct, refine, or re-trigger workflows to auto-suggest improvements. |
| **Agent Behavior Tuning** | Analyze how individual agents (Skald, Junzi, GAL) perform and recommend behavior profile adjustments. |

---

## Data Inputs for Meta-Learning

| Data Source | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Execution Logs | Track step-by-step task performance and error rates. |
| API Call Metrics | Monitor external service performance, costs, and success/failure rates. |
| User Feedback | Direct input from users (ratings, corrections, rephrases). |
| Agent Metrics | Measure individual agent success, speed, and reliability. |
| Recipe & Skill Outcomes | Track how effective each recipe and skill is in achieving desired outcomes. |
| Cost Data | Monitor API token usage and local compute resource costs. |

---

## Internal Modules

| Module | Function |
|---|---|
| **Metrics Collector** | Central ingestion point for all telemetry and performance data. |
| **Feedback Analyzer** | Processes user feedback events and integrates them into the learning loop. |
| **Service Performance Profiler** | Maintains per-adapter and per-API performance statistics. |
| **Skill & Recipe Scorer** | Calculates rolling success scores, failure rates, and optimization targets for each recipe and skill. |
| **Routing Optimizer** | Determines which adapter or model to use for future executions of a given skill. |
| **Execution Parameter Tuner** | Auto-adjusts LLM parameters and other runtime settings to improve quality or reduce cost. |
| **Failure Pattern Detector** | Recognizes recurring error types and suggests proactive mitigation steps. |
| **Learning Memory Store** | Long-term storage for all learned system performance history and tuning decisions. |

---

## Optimization Targets

| Metric | Optimization Goal |
|---|---|
| Latency | Minimize task execution time. |
| Accuracy | Maximize factual correctness and user satisfaction. |
| Cost | Minimize external API usage costs and local compute load. |
| Reliability | Reduce error and failure rates across all services and agents. |
| Agent Utilization | Balance workload across available agents to avoid bottlenecks. |
| Ethical Compliance | Ensure optimization doesn’t bypass ethical safeguards. |

---

## Workflow Example: Dynamic API Selection

**Scenario:**
- User runs a text summarization task.
- Historically, OpenAI API has been more expensive but faster.
- Ollama local model is slower but free.

**Meta-Learning Behavior:**
- For low-priority, long-form summarization, kOS routes to Ollama.
- For urgent user requests, kOS routes to OpenAI.
- Over time, system self-tunes thresholds for when to use which service.

---

## Data Storage & Privacy

- All performance logs and user feedback stored in the **Meta-Learning Memory Store**, linked to the user’s Vault.
- Full user control over retention, deletion, or anonymization of learning data.
- Option for opt-in participation in federated knowledge-sharing across nodes.

---

## Extensibility & Future Enhancements

| Planned Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| Federated Meta-Learning | Allow distributed kOS nodes to share anonymized learning metrics for cross-node optimization. |
| Reinforcement Learning Loops | Introduce policy optimization frameworks for more complex behavior tuning. |
| Explainable Learning Decisions | Let users review why certain optimizations were made ("Why did the system choose this adapter?"). |
| Cost Prediction Models | Forecast future API costs based on usage patterns. |

---

## Next Steps for Implementation

- Build Metrics Collector module.
- Develop Feedback Analyzer and storage layer.
- Implement basic Service Routing Optimizer for skill execution.
- Begin logging execution traces and API costs.
- Create dashboard UI for monitoring performance and optimization history.
