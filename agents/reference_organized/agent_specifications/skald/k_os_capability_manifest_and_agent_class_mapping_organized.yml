# kOS Capability Manifest and Agent Class Mapping

## Overview
The **kOS Capability Manifest and Agent Class Mapping** defines the formal relationship between system-wide capabilities, agent roles, node classes, and functional responsibilities across the kOS ecosystem. It acts as the master reference for agent-to-node deployment, execution permissions, and capability distribution.

This document establishes the blueprint for agent orchestration, load distribution, and ethical policy mapping at the agent class level.

---

## 1. Capability Manifest Structure

Each kOS capability is defined by:

- **Capability Name**
- **Description**
- **Required Agent Class**
- **Permitted Node Classes**
- **Execution Constraints**
- **Ethical Risk Profile (Low, Moderate, High)**
- **GEIG Enforcement Level (Mandatory/Optional/None)**

---

## 2. Official kOS Agent Classes (Initial 13 Classes)

| Agent Class | Primary Focus |
|------------|---------------|
| Discovery Agents | Signal detection and environment scanning |
| Observation Agents | Targeted monitoring and trend analysis |
| Processing Agents | Data analysis, transformation, and AI computation |
| Skald Agents | Communication, messaging, and narrative generation |
| Security Agents | Threat detection, prevention, and enforcement |
| Governance Agents | Policy management and consensus execution |
| Control Agents | Task orchestration and resource allocation |
| Execution Agents | Physical and API-level action execution |
| Memory Agents | Data storage, indexing, and recall |
| Ethics Agents | Ethical decision enforcement and GEIG management |
| Research Agents | Experimental modeling and simulation tasks (Future phase) |
| User Agents | User-facing interfaces and interaction management |
| Network Agents | Inter-node communication and routing (Future phase) |

*Note: Only the first 10 are active in initial deployment. Research, User, and Network Agents are scheduled for future phases.*

## 3. Example Capability-to-Agent Class Mapping

| Capability | Required Agent Class | Permitted Node Classes |
|-----------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Anomaly Detection | Discovery Agents | Discovery, Observation |
| Workflow Orchestration | Control Agents | Control |
| Threat Response | Security Agents | Security |
| Knowledge Graph Update | Memory Agents | Memory |
| External API Execution | Execution Agents | Execution |
| Policy Voting | Governance Agents | Governance |
| Data Summarization | Processing Agents | Processing |
| Message Generation | Skald Agents | Skald |
| Ethical Validation | Ethics Agents | Ethics |
| Backup Management | Memory Agents | Memory |

---

## 4. GEIG Enforcement Mapping

| Agent Class | GEIG Enforcement Level |
|------------|----------------------|
| Discovery Agents | Mandatory |
| Observation Agents | Mandatory |
| Processing Agents | Mandatory |
| Skald Agents | Mandatory |
| Security Agents | Mandatory |
| Governance Agents | Mandatory |
| Control Agents | Mandatory |
| Execution Agents | Mandatory |
| Memory Agents | Mandatory |
| Ethics Agents | N/A (GEIG Host Layer) |

---

## 5. Node Class Compatibility Matrix

| Node Class | Supported Agent Classes |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Discovery | Discovery Agents |
| Observation | Observation Agents |
| Processing | Processing Agents |
| Skald | Skald Agents |
| Security | Security Agents |
| Governance | Governance Agents |
| Control | Control Agents |
| Execution | Execution Agents |
| Memory | Memory Agents |
| Ethics | Ethics Agents |

---

## 6. Extensibility and Future Expansion

- Additional Agent Classes will be defined in Phase 11 and beyond (e.g., Research, User, Network).
- New capabilities will trigger manifest updates and require ethical review.
- All future Agent Classes will require a GEIG Risk Assessment prior to deployment.

---

## Conclusion
The **kOS Capability Manifest and Agent Class Mapping** serves as the operational and ethical binding layer between system functionality, agent execution roles, and node infrastructureâ€”ensuring scalable, auditable, and ethically governed system growth across the kOS ecosystem.

Next Step: Proceeding to **Phase 11: Agent Behavioral Patterns and Execution Constraints** documentation.
