# kOS Skill Registry and Management Tools Specification

## Overview

The **Skill Registry and Management Tools** are responsible for cataloging, versioning, validating, and exposing all executable skills within the kOS ecosystem. This ensures that all recipes, agents, and orchestration processes have a standardized, reliable interface for skill discovery and execution.

The Skill Registry acts as the **source of truth** for all available AI capabilities, whether they run on local tools, external APIs, or internal models.

---

## Core Responsibilities

| Responsibility | Description |
|---|---|
| **Skill Registration** | Allow developers and agents to register new skills into the system. |
| **Skill Versioning** | Maintain version history for each skill definition. |
| **Skill Discovery API** | Provide a searchable, queryable interface for agents and recipes to find available skills. |
| **Skill Metadata Management** | Store descriptions, input/output schemas, adapter mappings, and performance tags for each skill. |
| **Skill Validation & Testing** | Verify that new skills meet required schema, dependency, and runtime constraints before activation. |
| **Tagging & Classification** | Organize skills by Node Class responsibility, domain, adapter dependency, and use case. |
| **Skill Deprecation Handling** | Mark outdated skills and provide migration paths for recipes that depend on them. |

---

## Skill Metadata Schema

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **skill_name** | Unique identifier for the skill. |
| **version** | Semantic version (e.g., 1.2.0). |
| **author** | Agent or user who created the skill. |
| **description** | Human-readable summary of skill function. |
| **input_schema** | Required inputs, data types, and formats. |
| **output_schema** | Expected outputs and data types. |
| **adapter_dependency** | Which adapter(s) this skill depends on. |
| **node_class_alignment** | Which Node Class is primarily responsible for this skill. |
| **tags** | Searchable tags (e.g., summarization, classification, translation). |
| **test_status** | Pass/Fail result from last validation run. |
| **last_updated** | Timestamp of last edit or version bump. |

---

## Skill Lifecycle Workflow

1. **Skill Creation:** Developer or agent defines a new skill module.
2. **Validation Run:** Skill Registry runs automated schema and execution checks.
3. **Metadata Entry:** Skill metadata (inputs, outputs, Node Class, etc.) gets stored.
4. **Versioning:** Existing skills updated using semantic version control.
5. **Publishing:** Skill becomes available for recipes and agents.
6. **Monitoring:** Usage metrics (success rates, error frequency) tracked by Meta-Learning Layer.
7. **Deprecation (if needed):** Obsolete skills flagged with migration advice.

## Skill Registry API Endpoints (Example)

| Endpoint | Function |
|---|---|
| `GET /skills` | List all skills |
| `GET /skills/{skill_name}` | Get detailed metadata for a specific skill |
| `POST /skills/register` | Register a new skill |
| `PUT /skills/{skill_name}/update` | Update existing skill metadata |
| `DELETE /skills/{skill_name}` | Mark skill as deprecated |
| `GET /skills/search?tag={tag}` | Search skills by tag or capability |

---

## CLI Tools

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `kos-skill register` | Register a new skill from CLI. |
| `kos-skill test` | Run validation tests on a local skill file. |
| `kos-skill list` | Show all installed skills. |
| `kos-skill search --tag {tag}` | Search skills by tag. |
| `kos-skill inspect {skill_name}` | View detailed skill metadata. |
| `kos-skill deprecate {skill_name}` | Mark a skill as deprecated. |

---

## Skill Validation Criteria

| Check | Description |
|---|---|
| Schema Compliance | Input and output definitions match registry standards. |
| Adapter Availability | Required adapters are present and active. |
| Execution Test | Skill executes without critical errors in sandbox environment. |
| Node Class Tagging | Each skill must map to at least one official Node Class. |
| Ethical Safety Check | For user-facing or external-output skills, pass through ethics filter (Junzi). |

---

## Skill Classification Examples

| Skill Name | Node Class Alignment | Tags |
|---|---|---|
| summarize_text | Skald | summarization, NLP |
| ethical_check | Junzi | governance, safety, compliance |
| run_vector_search | GAL | RAG, semantic, knowledge |
| detect_user_tone | Dere | sentiment, emotion, interaction |
| check_api_auth | Vigil | security, authentication |

---

## Next Steps for Development

- Build Skill Registry backend (file-based or DB-backed for Phase 1).
- Develop Skill Registry API endpoints.
- Create CLI Skill Management Toolset.
- Integrate Skill Registry into Orchestration Engine lookup flow.
- Link Meta-Learning Layer for usage tracking and performance scoring.
