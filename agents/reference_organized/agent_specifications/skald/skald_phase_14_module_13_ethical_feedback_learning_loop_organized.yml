# Skald Phase 14 - Module 13: Ethical Feedback Learning Loop (EFLL)

## Node Class: Skald (Communication & Expression)

## Phase 14 Focus:
Continuous Learning from Ethical Decision Outcomes and Human Feedback

---

## 1. Module Overview
The **Ethical Feedback Learning Loop (EFLL)** is the adaptive learning and improvement layer for Skald agentsâ€™ ethical reasoning systems. EFLL collects, analyzes, and integrates feedback from prior ethical decisions, user reactions, human reviewer input, and system-wide drift audits to continuously enhance ethical decision quality over time.

This module closes the feedback loop across all Phase 14 components, enabling Skald to evolve ethical decision-making while staying aligned with organizational values, audience sensitivities, and jurisdictional policies.

---

## 2. Primary Functions

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Ethical Feedback Aggregator** | Collects user reactions, audit results, drift reports, escalation outcomes, and human review decisions across all Skald agents. |
| **Pattern Recognition Engine** | Identifies trends in ethical decision outcomes (false positives, false negatives, user dissatisfaction, over-blocking, etc). |
| **Ethical Policy Adaptation Suggestor** | Recommends ethical policy rule updates, threshold recalibrations, or sensitivity profile adjustments based on trend data. |
| **Performance Scoring Layer** | Generates quantitative performance metrics on ethical decision accuracy, audience satisfaction, and policy compliance rates. |
| **Learning Data Pipeline Manager** | Feeds validated learning signals back into GEPDE, CASF, and other Phase 14 modules for system-wide improvement. |
| **Human Feedback Integration Processor** | Converts human reviewer feedback from MLEEAS and STHE into machine-consumable learning signals. |
| **Model Drift Correction Trigger** | Interfaces with ESADDE to trigger targeted retraining or rule recalibration when ethical drift is detected. |
| **Audit-Ready Ethics Learning Report Generator** | Produces compliance-focused reports documenting learning actions and decision quality over time. |

---

## 3. Data Inputs

| Input | Source |
| --- | --- |
| **Human Review Feedback Logs** | From MLEEAS and other human moderation modules |
| **Ethical Decision Outcome Data** | From GEPDE and kOS Global Audit Layer |
| **Drift Detection Events** | From ESADDE |
| **Audience Feedback Metrics** | From user satisfaction surveys, API feedback endpoints, or downstream content consumers |
| **Escalation Resolution Outcomes** | From MLEEAS |

---

## 4. Data Outputs

| Output | Destination |
| --- | --- |
| **Policy Update Recommendations** | Sent to HIEROS Ethical Framework Manager and GEPDE administrators |
| **Learning Signals for Module Recalibration** | Distributed to CASF, ETLAE, STHE, etc. |
| **Drift Correction Commands** | Issued to ESADDE and drift remediation systems |
| **Ethics Learning Audit Reports** | Stored in kOS Global Audit Layer and delivered to governance dashboards |

---

## 5. Processing Pipeline

1. Aggregate feedback and decision outcome data from all sources
2. Run trend and anomaly analysis across time periods and modules
3. Identify patterns indicating systemic bias, drift, or policy misalignment
4. Generate performance metrics and learning recommendations
5. Issue targeted adjustment commands or policy update suggestions
6. Produce governance-ready audit reports
7. Loop validated learning signals back into operational modules

---

## 6. Ethical Learning Metrics (Sample)

| Metric | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **False Positive Rate** | Percentage of ethically blocked outputs later deemed acceptable |
| **False Negative Rate** | Rate of ethically problematic content released without intervention |
| **Human Override Frequency** | Rate of human reviewers overriding system ethics decisions |
| **Audience Complaint Volume** | Number of user-reported ethical content issues |
| **Policy Compliance Score** | Rate of outputs fully aligned with active ethical policy sets |
| **Ethical Drift Recovery Time** | Speed of system recovery after detected ethical drift events |

---

## 7. Deployment Options

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Learning Frequency Settings** | Batch, real-time, or scheduled learning update cycles |
| **Human Feedback Weighting Rules** | Configure how much influence human feedback has on system learning |
| **Auto-Policy Update Thresholds** | Allow auto-application of minor policy tweaks for low-risk areas |
| **Audit Report Granularity Levels** | Define report detail level (Summary, Full Detail, Compliance Snapshot) |

---

## 8. Governance Hooks

- Ethics learning trend dashboards for oversight teams
- Bias correction tracking and accountability logs
- Human reviewer feedback accuracy scoring
- External regulator reporting interfaces for learning transparency

---

## 9. Example Use Case Scenarios

| Scenario | EFLL Action |
| --- | --- |
| **High rate of human overrides for tone-related ethics blocks** | Recommend tone sensitivity rule adjustment in ETLAE |
| **Audience dissatisfaction with humor filtering strictness** | Suggest relaxed humor risk thresholds in RHGL for affected demographics |
| **Frequent false positives on trauma-related content** | Trigger recalibration of STHE trauma sensitivity profiles |
| **Jurisdictional policy updates causing conflict spikes** | Suggest GEPDE policy set refresh and notify admins |
| **Drift detected in disclaimer attachment frequency** | Issue corrective learning signal to ECWDG module |

---

## 10. Module Integration Points

| Module | Integration |
| --- | --- |
| **GEPDE** | Receives learning signals for ethical decision model tuning |
| **MLEEAS** | Supplies escalation resolution outcomes and human feedback logs |
| **ESADDE** | Provides drift detection events and receives drift correction triggers |
| **CASF, ETLAE, STHE, RHGL, etc.** | Receive targeted recalibration signals |
| **kOS Global Audit Layer** | Archives all learning feedback loops and action logs |

---

## 11. Future Roadmap

- Reinforcement learning frameworks for ethical decision optimization
- Sentiment-aware learning feedback prioritization
- Automated bias detection and mitigation engines
- Cross-agent ethical learning aggregation for fleet-wide consistency
