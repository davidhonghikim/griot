# Phase 8 Module Specification – Module 5: FRACTAL (Federated Resource and Contextual Task Allocation Layer)

## Module Name

**FRACTAL – Federated Resource and Contextual Task Allocation Layer**

## Purpose

FRACTAL handles distributed, federated task orchestration across multiple nodes and agents within the kOS ecosystem. It is responsible for splitting, delegating, coordinating, and recombining tasks based on node availability, resource capacity, execution history, and contextual relevance.

FRACTAL ensures efficient, context-aware load distribution and parallel execution of multi-part or large-scale tasks across geographically or logically separated nodes.

## Functional Overview

### Primary Functions:

1. **Federated Task Splitting and Distribution**

   - Decomposes large tasks into micro-tasks or subtasks
   - Distributes subtasks across eligible nodes or agents

2. **Context-Aware Node Selection**

   - Uses metadata, proximity, resource status, and historical performance for intelligent routing

3. **Task Tracking and Coordination**

   - Monitors task execution across distributed entities
   - Reassembles and reconciles partial results into unified outputs

4. **Load-Aware Scheduling**

   - Considers current node load, resource availability, and system latency in task placement

5. **Failure Recovery and Reallocation**

   - Detects stalled, failed, or delayed tasks
   - Reassigns to alternative nodes with minimal disruption

---

## Detailed Module Architecture

### Input Channels:

- Task submission from Orchestrator or external API
- Resource availability metrics from ARC
- Node health data from NIMBUS and OMNI
- Execution feedback from DERE

### Output Channels:

- Distributed task assignments to DERE and target nodes
- Execution status updates to Orchestrator
- Load distribution logs to OMNI
- Failure notifications to VESPER

### Core Components:

| Component                         | Description                                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Task Decomposer (TD)**          | Breaks down large jobs into distributable subtasks                           |
| **Node Selector (NS)**            | Chooses optimal nodes for each subtask based on resource and context metrics |
| **Task Dispatcher (TDP)**         | Issues task execution commands to DERE and target nodes                      |
| **Result Aggregator (RA)**        | Collects and reconciles partial results into final task output               |
| **Failure Recovery Engine (FRE)** | Manages failed or stalled subtask reallocation                               |
| **Load Balancer (LB)**            | Dynamically adjusts task flow based on live system load                      |

## Key Algorithms and Processes

1. **Contextual Node Ranking Algorithm (CNRA)**

   - Factors: Proximity, resource load, execution history, node health
   - Output: Ranked node list for each subtask

2. **Task Splitting Logic (TSL)**

   - Input: Task type, size, execution requirements
   - Output: Subtask map

3. **Dynamic Load Distribution Model (DLDM)**

   - Balances subtask flow to avoid overload on any single node

4. **Result Reconciliation Protocol (RRP)**

   - Handles ordered or unordered result aggregation
   - Supports partial result tolerances where allowed

5. **Failure-Triggered Reallocation Process (FTRP)**

   - Detects failed subtask
   - Reissues to backup node with adjusted execution window

## API Endpoints (Internal to kOS)

| Endpoint                      | Method | Description                              |
| ----------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `/fractal/submit_task`        | POST   | Submit a new task for distribution       |
| `/fractal/task_status`        | GET    | Retrieve status of distributed tasks     |
| `/fractal/reallocate_task`    | POST   | Manually trigger task reallocation       |
| `/fractal/aggregation_result` | GET    | Fetch final aggregated task result       |
| `/fractal/node_candidates`    | GET    | Get ranked node list for task allocation |

## Dependencies

- **DERE (Entity Runtime Execution)**
- **ARC (Resource Awareness)**
- **NIMBUS (Node Status)**
- **OMNI (Operational Telemetry)**
- **VESPER (Failure Event Logging)**

---

## Deployment Considerations

- Should scale horizontally for large distributed environments
- Requires low-latency decision-making for real-time task routing
- Resilient to partial node outages and network partitions
- Support for both synchronous and asynchronous task models

---

## Testing and Validation Requirements

- Task decomposition integrity tests
- Load-balanced task distribution under varying system loads
- Failure and reallocation stress scenarios
- Distributed result aggregation accuracy checks
- Node ranking algorithm validation with simulated telemetry

---

## Future Extensions

- ML-based node performance prediction models
- Geo-distributed task optimization
- Cross-cluster and cross-datacenter federation support
