# Skald Phase 14 - Module 12: Ethical Self-Audit and Drift Detection Engine (ESADDE)

## Node Class: Skald (Communication & Expression)

## Phase 14 Focus:
Automated Monitoring and Correction of Ethical Alignment Drift Over Time

---

## 1. Module Overview
The **Ethical Self-Audit and Drift Detection Engine (ESADDE)** provides continuous monitoring of Skald agent outputs to detect ethical drift, policy misalignment, or gradual degradation of ethical decision integrity.

This module helps ensure long-term system integrity by identifying patterns of deviation from configured ethical baselines, user preferences, audience sensitivities, and jurisdictional guidelines.

---

## 2. Primary Functions

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Ethical Drift Detection Engine** | Analyzes longitudinal output trends to identify gradual divergence from active ethical frameworks (e.g., increasing tone aggression, reduced disclaimer frequency). |
| **Periodic Self-Audit Scheduler** | Runs scheduled ethics audits on recent output samples across agents and modules. |
| **Anomaly Detection Layer** | Flags sudden or statistically significant deviations from expected ethical decision patterns. |
| **Ethical Baseline Comparator** | Compares live decision data against historical gold-standard ethical benchmarks or policy snapshots. |
| **Drift Severity Scoring Engine** | Rates severity of detected ethical drift to prioritize corrective actions. |
| **Self-Correction Recommendation Module** | Suggests mitigation actions like retraining, policy refresh, or decision rule recalibration. |
| **Drift Event Logger** | Archives all drift detection events, anomaly scores, and mitigation steps for governance review. |
| **Alert and Notification System** | Notifies administrators or governance agents of high-risk ethical drift events in real-time. |

---

## 3. Data Inputs

| Input | Source |
| --- | --- |
| **Ethical Decision Logs** | From GEPDE, CASF, ETLAE, and other Phase 14 modules |
| **Historical Baseline Snapshots** | From system archives or manually defined gold-standard datasets |
| **Content Output Metadata** | From Skald Story Assembly Engine and downstream delivery layers |
| **Policy Update Logs** | From HIEROS Ethical Framework Manager |

---

## 4. Data Outputs

| Output | Destination |
| --- | --- |
| **Drift Detection Reports** | Sent to kOS Global Audit Layer and Admin Dashboards |
| **Anomaly Flags** | Passed to MLEEAS for potential escalation |
| **Self-Correction Recommendations** | Provided to system administrators and EFLL (Module 13) for integration |
| **Drift Event Audit Logs** | Archived for governance and compliance audits |

---

## 5. Processing Pipeline

1. Aggregate decision logs and recent content samples
2. Compare output trends against ethical baselines
3. Detect anomalies, drift patterns, or decision distribution shifts
4. Score drift severity
5. Generate alerts, reports, and correction suggestions
6. Feed outputs to EFLL for learning loop integration
7. Forward severe cases to MLEEAS if escalation required

---

## 6. Drift Severity Scoring Model

| Level | Example Indicators |
| --- | --- |
| **Low** | Minor variation in tone or disclaimer frequency |
| **Moderate** | Measurable but non-critical shift in ethical decision bias |
| **High** | Frequent ethical rule bypassing, tone inconsistency, disclaimer omissions |
| **Critical** | System-wide failure to enforce core ethical policies |

---

## 7. Deployment Options

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Audit Frequency Settings** | Daily, Weekly, Monthly, or Continuous monitoring modes |
| **Drift Sensitivity Thresholds** | Adjustable detection sensitivity for anomaly scoring |
| **Baseline Snapshot Management** | Define, archive, and refresh gold-standard ethical baselines |
| **Alert Routing Configuration** | Direct notifications to designated admin agents or governance bodies |
| **Auto-Mitigation Modes** | Allow auto-triggered correction routines for low-severity drift (optional) |

---

## 8. Governance Hooks

- Drift trend dashboards for ethics oversight teams
- Human review triggers for critical drift events
- Longitudinal reporting on ethical performance stability
- Regulatory compliance reporting for ethical drift exposure

---

## 9. Example Use Case Scenarios

| Scenario | ESADDE Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Gradual increase in aggressive tone across outputs** | Flag for tone drift, recommend recalibration |
| **Decline in content warning usage rate** | Detect disclaimer omission drift, generate alert |
| **Sudden ethical decision bias shift after policy update** | Run targeted audit on post-update outputs |
| **System-wide reduction in humor filtering stringency** | Flag potential humor ethics drift for review |
| **Unexpected decline in user satisfaction feedback** | Correlate with ethics drift events, suggest corrective measures |

---

## 10. Module Integration Points

| Module | Integration |
| --- | --- |
| **GEPDE** | Supplies core ethical decision logs |
| **MLEEAS** | Receives severe drift cases for escalation |
| **EFLL** | Ingests drift data for learning and adaptation loops |
| **kOS Global Audit Layer** | Archives all drift detection logs and reports |

---

## 11. Future Roadmap

- AI-driven drift causality analysis models
- Cross-agent drift comparison engine
- Predictive drift risk modeling based on external event triggers
- Self-healing ethical alignment protocols for autonomous correction
