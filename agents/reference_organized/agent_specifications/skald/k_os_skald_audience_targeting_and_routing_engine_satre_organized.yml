# kOS Skald Audience Targeting and Routing Engine (SATRE)

## Overview
The **kOS Skald Audience Targeting and Routing Engine (SATRE)** is the decision-making layer responsible for determining the most appropriate audience, delivery channel, timing, and routing pathway for every message generated by the Skald Contextual Message Generator (SCMG).

SATRE ensures that each message reaches the right recipient, in the right format, at the right time, over the right channelâ€”while enforcing ethical and operational constraints set by GEIG and user/system preferences.

---

## 1. Core Responsibilities

- Audience segmentation
- Delivery channel selection
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Message queueing and prioritization
- Ethical compliance filtering on distribution targets

---

## 2. Audience Classification Levels

- **User:** Individual human users (Admins, Operators, End Users)
- **Agent:** Specific system agents (Monitoring agents, Data processors, etc.)
- **Node:** Entire nodes or node clusters
- **External System:** Third-party services or external APIs
- **Broadcast:** System-wide or cluster-wide announcements

---

## 3. Channel Types Supported

- WebSocket (real-time agent-to-agent or agent-to-UI communication)
- REST API callbacks
- Email (SMTP integration optional)
- SMS (via pluggable SMS gateways)
- In-app UI notifications
- External Pub/Sub endpoints
- Optional LoRa/BLE/RF signaling for off-grid nodes

---

## 4. Routing Decision Factors

- Recipient availability (online/offline)
- Channel health and latency
- Message priority level
- User preferences and agent capability constraints
- Historical delivery success rates
- Ethical targeting rules (from GEIG)

---

## 5. Delivery Scheduling Features

- Immediate dispatch for high-priority messages
- Batch mode for low-priority or bulk communications
- Scheduled delivery windows for non-urgent messages
- Retry logic for failed deliveries

---

## 6. Rate Limiting and Throttling

- Configurable per recipient, channel, or message type
- Dynamic backoff during high system load
- Prevention of notification floods
- Audit trails for rate-limit triggers

---

## 7. Ethical Targeting Safeguards

- No cross-boundary delivery without GEIG approval (e.g., user to external system)
- Sensitive data masking for messages routed outside trust boundaries
- Audience impact scoring for mass communications
- Escalation triggers for ethically sensitive audience targeting decisions

---

## 8. API Endpoints

- `/satre/audience/resolve`
- `/satre/delivery/queue`
- `/satre/channel/status`
- `/satre/routing/metrics`
- `/satre/throttle/check`
- `/satre/dispatch/execute`

---

## 9. Performance and Scaling

- Horizontal scalability across multiple routing nodes
- Asynchronous message queue processing
- Priority queue tiers for time-sensitive messaging
- Load-adaptive delivery windows

---

## 10. Advanced Features

- AI-driven delivery time optimization based on recipient behavior patterns
- Multi-channel fallback (auto-switch channel on delivery failure)
- Audience segmentation learning from Knowledge Graph insights
- Delivery A/B testing for system-generated messages

---

## Conclusion
The **kOS Skald Audience Targeting and Routing Engine (SATRE)** ensures that every generated message reaches the intended audience in the most effective, ethical, and efficient manner, with intelligent routing logic and dynamic delivery optimization across the entire kOS ecosystem.
