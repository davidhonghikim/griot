# Skald Module Specification: Partner System Integration Hub (PSIH)

## Module Name
**Skald Partner System Integration Hub (PSIH)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Skald Partner System Integration Hub (PSIH) provides a centralized framework for integrating Skald with external partner platforms, third-party services, and enterprise systems. PSIH enables bi-directional, policy-controlled data exchange and service orchestration between Skald and external entities via connectors, adapters, and protocol translation layers.

## Purpose
To allow Skald to securely and flexibly interoperate with external partner systems, enabling workflow triggers, data sharing, result ingestion, and collaborative service chains with external platforms.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. External System Connector Framework
- **Pluggable Connector Architecture:** Allow easy deployment of partner-specific adapters.
- **Supported Protocols:** REST, SOAP, gRPC, Webhooks, FTP/SFTP, AMQP, and custom partner APIs.
- **Authentication Handlers:** Support OAuth2, API Key, Basic Auth, and custom token schemes per partner.

### 2. Partner Workflow Orchestration
- **Event-Based Triggering:** Allow Skald workflows to trigger partner system actions based on defined events.
- **Inbound Workflow Activation:** Support partner systems triggering Skald workflows via API or event bus subscriptions.
- **SLA-Aware Partner Interactions:** Monitor partner response times and enforce external SLA policies.

### 3. Data Mapping and Transformation
- **Field Mapping Engine:** Translate partner data formats into Skald’s internal schemas (integrated with DFTTL).
- **Pre/Post Processing Hooks:** Allow data manipulation before send or after receive.
- **Error Handling Policies:** Define retry, fallback, and escalation strategies for failed partner interactions.

### 4. Partner Access and Policy Control
- **Per-Partner Rate Limits:** Enforce throttling for high-volume partner integrations.
- **API Key Management for Partners:** Issue and manage partner-specific API keys or tokens.
- **Contract Enforcement Engine:** Validate partner requests against predefined service contracts and usage limits.

### 5. Monitoring and Auditing
- **Partner Activity Dashboards:** Visualize partner API call rates, success/failure stats, and latency trends.
- **Partner-Specific Audit Logs:** Feed all partner interactions into CALE for compliance and troubleshooting.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Alert on unusual partner activity patterns.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Latency:** Sub-300ms average processing for partner interaction flows.
- **Extensibility:** Allow addition of new partner connectors without downtime.
- **Security:** Full encryption, partner-specific authentication, and policy enforcement.
- **Reliability:** Built-in retry and failover mechanisms for partner API calls.

## Data Flow Diagram (Textual)
1. **Skald Event / Workflow → PSIH Outbound Connector → Partner System API → Response Handling → Skald Module**

2. **Partner System Trigger → PSIH Inbound API → Skald Workflow Orchestrator / Target Module**

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** External Partner Systems, Skald Internal Modules, Admin Control Panel (ACP).
- **Output Interfaces:** External Partner Systems, Audit Logging (CALE), Metrics and Telemetry Systems (MTVE).

## Configuration Options
- **Enabled Connectors:** Per partner.
- **Retry Policies:** Configurable per partner.
- **Rate Limits:** Per partner API key.
- **Transformation Rules:** Integrated with DFTTL.

## Example Use Cases
- Triggering a partner’s content moderation service from within a Skald workflow.
- Receiving processing completion notifications from a partner system.
- Exporting workflow outputs to a partner’s data warehouse.
- Monitoring SLA compliance for partner API response times.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **Custom Partner Adapter API:** For proprietary external systems.
- **Dynamic Connector Loader:** Add or update partner integrations at runtime.
- **External Service Registry Integration:** Auto-discover partner endpoints.

## Testing and Validation Plan
- Multi-protocol partner connector tests.
- Partner API authentication flow validation.
- SLA breach simulation tests.
- Failure retry and fallback scenario testing.

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **External API Gateway (EAGRL)**
- **Data Format Translation Layer (DFTTL)**
- **Audit Logging and Compliance Engine (ALC)**
- **Metrics and Telemetry Visualization Engine (MTVE)**

## Future Enhancements
- AI-driven partner SLA breach forecasting.
- Integration with external service discovery platforms.
- Auto-tuning of partner rate limits based on observed load.
- API gateway passthrough mode for proxy-style integrations.
