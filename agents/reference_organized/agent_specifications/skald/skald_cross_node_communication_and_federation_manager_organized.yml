# Skald Module Specification: Cross-Node Communication and Federation Manager (CNCFM)

## Module Name
**Skald Cross-Node Communication and Federation Manager (CNCFM)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Skald Cross-Node Communication and Federation Manager (CNCFM) enables seamless communication, data exchange, and distributed coordination between Skald nodes across different geographic regions, network zones, or organizational boundaries. CNCFM manages inter-node messaging, workflow delegation, data synchronization, and policy-controlled federation of Skald instances.

## Purpose
To support multi-node Skald deployments with distributed data processing, cross-cluster workflow orchestration, and inter-organizational federation scenarios while ensuring consistency, security, and SLA adherence.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Cross-Node Messaging Bus
- **Message Routing Engine:** Facilitate point-to-point, broadcast, and multicast message flows between Skald nodes.
- **Guaranteed Delivery:** Support message persistence and retry for at-least-once delivery.
- **Message Prioritization:** Allow priority-based queueing for critical inter-node messages.
- **Encryption-in-Transit:** Ensure all inter-node traffic is encrypted.

### 2. Workflow Delegation and Remote Execution
- **Workflow Handoff Mechanism:** Enable delegation of workflow stages to remote Skald nodes.
- **Execution Status Feedback:** Provide real-time progress updates from remote nodes.
- **Cross-Node SLA Tracking:** Monitor SLA performance across node boundaries.

### 3. Data Synchronization and Replication
- **Artifact Sync Engine:** Replicate workflow outputs, artifacts, and telemetry between nodes as needed.
- **Conflict Resolution Policies:** Handle data version conflicts during synchronization.
- **Bandwidth Throttling:** Manage network usage during large data sync operations.

### 4. Federation Policy Control
- **Federation Topology Management:** Define which nodes can communicate and under what conditions.
- **Access Control Rules:** Enforce authorization policies on cross-node requests.
- **Data Residency Enforcement:** Prevent unauthorized data transfers across geographic or jurisdictional boundaries.

### 5. Monitoring and Auditability
- **Inter-Node Traffic Dashboard:** Visualize message flow rates, latencies, and error rates between nodes.
- **Cross-Node Error Logging:** Feed communication errors into CALE for auditing.
- **Federation Health Monitoring:** Track connectivity and performance of federated nodes.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Low Latency:** Sub-500ms average round-trip time for inter-node control messages.
- **High Availability:** Automatic failover for critical inter-node communication links.
- **Extensibility:** Support new message types and cross-node APIs without downtime.
- **Security:** Mutual TLS, signed messages, and role-based federation access controls.

## Data Flow Diagram (Textual)

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** Skald Internal Modules (SWO, OASDL, ALC, etc.), Admin Control Panel (ACP).
- **Output Interfaces:** Remote Skald Node CNCFM Instances, Audit Logging (CALE), Metrics and Telemetry Visualization Engine (MTVE).

## Configuration Options
- **Federation Topology:** Node whitelist/blacklist.
- **Retry Policies:** For failed message deliveries.
- **Bandwidth Limits:** For sync operations.
- **Data Residency Zones:** For policy enforcement.

## Example Use Cases
- Offloading large workflows to compute-heavy remote nodes.
- Synchronizing telemetry data between regional Skald deployments.
- Enforcing GDPR data residency constraints during cross-node transfers.
- Monitoring inter-node SLA compliance.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **Custom Message Type Plugin API:** For new inter-node communication patterns.
- **Dynamic Federation Policy Loader:** Allow runtime changes to federation rules.
- **External Federation Directory Integration:** For enterprise-wide node discovery.

## Testing and Validation Plan
- Inter-node message delivery latency benchmarking.
- SLA enforcement validation across node boundaries.
- Federation topology configuration tests.
- Network partition and failover scenario simulation.

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **Workflow Orchestrator (SWO)**
- **Output Artifact Storage and Delivery Layer (OASDL)**
- **Audit Logging and Compliance Engine (ALC)**
- **Metrics and Telemetry Visualization Engine (MTVE)**

## Future Enhancements
- AI-driven federation topology optimization.
- Self-healing inter-node communication mesh.
- Cross-node SLA breach early-warning system.
- Federation-wide security incident propagation.
