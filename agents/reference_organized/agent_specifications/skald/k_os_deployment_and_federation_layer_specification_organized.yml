# kOS Deployment and Federation Layer Specification

## Overview

The **kOS Deployment and Federation Layer** governs how Kind AI OS nodes are installed, configured, distributed, and networked across diverse hardware, environments, and user ownership models. It supports both **single-node standalone deployments** and **federated multi-node ecosystems**, allowing global scalability while preserving user sovereignty.

This layer enables kOS agents, node classes, and services to run seamlessly across:

- Personal devices (laptops, smartphones, Raspberry Pi)
- Local servers (home labs, small business networks)
- Cloud environments (user-controlled VMs)
- Federated peer-to-peer networks
- Edge devices (future IoT, wearable, embedded deployments)

---

## Core Responsibilities

| Responsibility | Description |
|---|---|
| **Node Deployment Management** | Automate installation, configuration, and initialization of kOS nodes on various hardware profiles. |
| **Node Class Allocation** | Assign appropriate Node Classes (from the 13 culturally themed official set) based on deployment role, capacity, and user preference. |
| **Federation Protocols** | Define how nodes discover, trust, and communicate with each other in distributed networks. |
| **Privacy & Data Boundary Enforcement** | Respect and enforce user-defined data sovereignty between nodes. |
| **Load Distribution** | Allow task routing and skill execution to be shared across federated nodes for scalability and resilience. |
| **Node Health Monitoring** | Track node availability, resource status, and performance across the network. |
| **Versioning & Updates** | Provide mechanisms for node updates, rollbacks, and version control. |

---

## Supported Deployment Modes

| Mode | Description |
|---|---|
| **Local Standalone Mode** | All kOS components run on a single user-owned device (full-stack deployment). |
| **Hybrid Mode** | Some services run locally; others call external APIs (early phases). |
| **Multi-Node Personal Mesh** | A single user runs kOS nodes across multiple personal devices (laptop + phone + Pi). |
| **Federated Network Mode** | Multiple users/nodes collaborate and share resources across a distributed network. |
| **Private Cloud Mode** | User hosts kOS on private VPS or cloud infrastructure for always-on operation. |

---

## Federation Protocol Features

| Feature | Function |
|---|---|
| **Node Discovery** | Lightweight decentralized discovery service for peer nodes (optional via DHT, mDNS, or user-invited peer lists). |
| **Authentication & Trust Management** | Node-to-node authentication using public/private keypairs. Trust levels definable per peer. |
| **Message Passing Protocol** | Lightweight, encrypted messaging layer for inter-node recipe dispatch, agent messaging, and artifact sharing. |
| **Resource Sharing Rules** | Users control what skills, recipes, agents, or compute capacity can be shared with the network. |
| **Opt-in Federated Learning** | Nodes can contribute anonymized performance/learning data to improve collective optimization (optional). |
| **Cross-Node Artifact Referencing** | Allows nodes to reference artifacts on remote nodes without mandatory data transfer. |

---

## Node Class Distribution Across Deployments

| Deployment Scale | Recommended Node Class Allocation |
|---|---|
| **Single-Device Personal Node** | One instance per Node Class, scaled down (Skald, Junzi, GAL, Dere, etc.). |
| **Home Lab / Small Business** | Distributed Node Class deployment across multiple machines (e.g., Junzi on one Pi, GAL on another). |
| **Cloud-Hosted Node** | Full multi-class node stack with redundancy and load-balancing. |
| **Federated Social Network** | Multiple users running specific Node Classes (some specializing as Skald Nodes, others as GAL Nodes, etc.). |

---

## Deployment Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **kOS Node Installer CLI** | Command-line installation and deployment automation tool. |
| **Node Class Allocator** | Recommends Node Class distribution based on hardware and user goals. |
| **Federation Configurator** | UI/CLI for setting up node-to-node trust, discovery, and federation settings. |
| **Node Health Dashboard** | Monitor node uptime, resource utilization, and error rates. |
| **Update Manager** | Handles incremental updates, patches, and version rollbacks. |

---

## Security Considerations

- All federation communication encrypted (TLS or lightweight E2EE alternative).
- Per-node public/private key identity.
- Federated resource access controlled by per-node ACLs.
- Federation join/leave history logged for auditability.
- Optional user-configurable anonymity mode for nodes.

---

## Extensibility & Future Enhancements

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Mobile & Embedded Deployments** | Support for Android, iOS, and microcontroller-based nodes (Phase 6+). |
| **Auto-Healing Node Meshes** | Redundant load-balancing and failover for distributed clusters. |
| **Federated Knowledge Exchange Protocol** | Allow opt-in recipe, skill, and artifact sharing across trusted nodes. |
| **Self-Organizing Node Clusters** | Nodes dynamically form temporary working clusters for large tasks. |
| **Deployment Templates for Common Use Cases** | Predefined deployment blueprints for common user goals (personal assistant, home automation hub, etc.). |

---

## Next Steps for Development

- Build Node Installer CLI with Node Class selector.
- Implement Federation Configurator and Node Trust Manager.
- Develop Node Health Monitoring service.
- Design secure message-passing layer for inter-node coordination.
- Begin testing small-scale federated networks in lab environments.
