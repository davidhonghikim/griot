# Skald Module Specification: Interoperability Policy and Contract Enforcement Engine (IPCEE)

## Module Name
**Skald Interoperability Policy and Contract Enforcement Engine (IPCEE)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Skald Interoperability Policy and Contract Enforcement Engine (IPCEE) governs external interaction policies, service-level contracts, and compliance rules for all third-party integrations, external APIs, partner systems, and cross-node communications. IPCEE enforces service contracts, SLA guarantees, data handling rules, rate limits, and access boundaries for interoperability flows.

## Purpose
To ensure that all Skald external integrations and interoperability interactions remain within the boundaries of defined contracts, policies, and regulatory compliance frameworks, while protecting internal system resources from abuse or misconfiguration.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Contract Definition and Management
- **Service Contract Repository:** Maintain definitions of expected behavior for each external partner, API client, or cross-node integration.
- **SLA Rule Engine:** Define allowable service levels (latency, throughput, uptime, etc.) per contract.
- **Policy Metadata Loader:** Support dynamic loading and updating of interoperability policies.

### 2. Runtime Contract Enforcement
- **Real-Time SLA Monitoring:** Evaluate ongoing interoperability flows against defined SLA thresholds.
- **Quota and Rate Limit Enforcement:** Enforce per-contract quotas and call limits.
- **Usage Pattern Analysis:** Detect contract violations based on usage anomalies.
- **Violation Response Actions:** Support blocking, throttling, alerting, or escalating on contract breach.

### 3. Policy-Driven Data Governance
- **Data Residency Policies:** Prevent prohibited data transfers across defined jurisdictional boundaries.
- **Content Type Restrictions:** Enforce allowed data types per partner or integration.
- **Data Retention Control:** Apply contract-specific retention rules for externally exchanged data.
- **Privacy Compliance Filters:** Auto-redact or block sensitive fields when policies dictate.

### 4. Compliance and Audit Support
- **Contract Breach Logging:** Record all contract violation incidents.
- **SLA Compliance Reporting:** Generate periodic reports on SLA adherence for each partner or client.
- **Historical Violation Tracking:** Maintain searchable logs of past interoperability policy violations.

### 5. Policy Definition Interfaces
- **Admin UI for Policy Management:** Allow authorized admins to define, update, and retire interoperability policies.
- **Policy API:** Provide programmatic access for external systems to retrieve applicable interoperability policies.
- **Simulation Mode:** Allow dry-run testing of new policies without enforcing them.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Enforcement Latency:** Policy checks and SLA evaluations must add less than 50ms per transaction.
- **Extensibility:** Support new contract types and policy dimensions over time.
- **Resilience:** Continue policy enforcement even during backend outages using cached policy rules.
- **Security:** Prevent unauthorized policy changes; full role-based access control.

## Data Flow Diagram (Textual)
1. **External Request / Event → IPCEE Policy Engine → Policy Validator → SLA Monitor / Quota Checker / Data Filter → Allow / Throttle / Block / Alert → Log Outcome in CALE → Response to External System**

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** External API Gateway (EAGRL), Partner System Integration Hub (PSIH), Cross-Node Communication Manager (CNCFM), Admin Control Panel (ACP).
- **Output Interfaces:** Audit Logging (CALE), Admin Dashboard (DVL), External Reporting Systems.

## Configuration Options
- **SLA Definitions:** Per partner or API client.
- **Quota Limits:** Daily / Monthly per integration.
- **Data Residency Rules:** Configurable per tenant or partner.
- **Violation Response Profiles:** Per policy type.

## Example Use Cases
- Blocking a partner making excessive API calls beyond agreed rate limits.
- Enforcing that no PII leaves designated geographic regions.
- Throttling cross-node event traffic during peak load periods.
- Generating monthly SLA adherence reports for contract compliance.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **Custom SLA Check Modules:** For domain-specific SLA evaluation logic.
- **Dynamic Policy Loader:** Allow runtime updates to interoperability contracts.
- **AI-Based Contract Breach Predictor:** For future contract risk forecasting.

## Testing and Validation Plan
- SLA violation simulation tests.
- Quota enforcement correctness tests.
- Policy configuration UI validation.
- Contract breach alerting and escalation flow tests.

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **External API Gateway (EAGRL)**
- **Partner System Integration Hub (PSIH)**
- **Cross-Node Communication and Federation Manager (CNCFM)**
- **Audit Logging and Compliance Engine (ALC)**

## Future Enhancements
- AI-driven SLA risk scoring.
- Automatic policy generation based on historical usage.
- Smart contract support for blockchain-anchored interoperability agreements.
- Real-time policy enforcement analytics dashboard.
