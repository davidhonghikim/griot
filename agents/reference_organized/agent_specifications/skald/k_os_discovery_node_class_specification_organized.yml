# kOS Discovery Node Class Specification

## Overview
The **kOS Discovery Node Class** serves as the environmental intelligence and external data sensing layer of the kOS ecosystem. Discovery Nodes are responsible for continuous observation, scanning, and data acquisition from both internal system telemetry and external real-world or digital environments.

Discovery Nodes form the sensory grid that powers situational awareness, decision-making, and real-time event detection across all other node classes.

---

## 1. Primary Roles and Functions

- Continuous data collection from defined sources
- Signal pattern recognition and anomaly detection
- Real-time event monitoring
- Passive and active network scanning
- Sensor fusion and contextual enrichment
- Feeding raw and pre-processed data to the Data Fabric and Skald GCTE

---

## 2. Supported Data Sources

- Network traffic analysis
- API feeds (external or internal)
- IoT device inputs
- Web scrapers or external service monitors
- Local telemetry (CPU, memory, disk, etc.)
- External sensors (environmental, acoustic, visual, RF, etc.)

---

## 3. Standard Agent Types within Discovery Nodes

- **Telemetry Collector Agents**
- **Anomaly Detection Agents**
- **Sensor Data Normalizers**
- **Signal Amplification and Noise Filtering Agents**
- **Ethical Data Pre-Filter Agents (GEIG-bound)**

---

## 4. Internal Architecture

### 4.1 Input Processing Pipeline
- Multi-source data listeners
- Input validation and schema enforcement
- GEIG-filtered ingestion controls

### 4.2 Signal Processing Layer
- Statistical analysis modules
- Threshold-based alert triggers
- Optional ML-based anomaly scoring

### 4.3 Output Routing Layer
- Context-enriched data forwarding to:
  - DTCE (for transformation)
  - GEIG (for ethical checks)
  - Data Fabric (for storage)
  - GCTE (for trigger generation)

---

## 5. Ethical and Security Considerations

- GEIG enforcement on all external data streams
- Privacy masking for user-sensitive inputs
- Anonymization modules for 3rd-party data
- Intrusion detection for source manipulation attempts

---

## 6. Performance and Scaling

- High-throughput ingestion pipelines
- Horizontal scaling across large sensor arrays
- Load shedding for non-critical data during system stress
- Real-time backpressure handling

---

## 7. Monitoring and Observability

- Source-wise data flow metrics
- Anomaly heatmaps
- Signal health and noise ratio dashboards
- Data ingestion latency monitoring

---

## 8. Optional Advanced Features

- AI-driven adaptive sensing policies
- Event correlation across multiple Discovery Nodes
- Integration with external threat intelligence feeds
- Federated sensing across multiple clusters

---

## 9. Example Use Cases

- Environmental monitoring for IoT deployments
- External API rate tracking and outage detection
- Anomaly detection in network traffic
- User behavioral telemetry for system performance tuning
- External news/event feed scanning for contextual triggers

---

## Conclusion
The **kOS Discovery Node Class** acts as the sensory cortex of the kOS ecosystemâ€”detecting, filtering, and reporting on all meaningful environmental and system events while maintaining ethical data handling standards and real-time responsiveness.

Next Step: Proceeding to the **Observation Node Class** specification.
