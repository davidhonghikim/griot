# Skald Module Specification: Privacy and Data Access Logging Layer (PDALL)

## Module Name
**Skald Privacy and Data Access Logging Layer (PDALL)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Skald Privacy and Data Access Logging Layer (PDALL) provides specialized logging and monitoring for all user data access, modification, export, and deletion actions within the Skald system. PDALL ensures Skald complies with privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, etc.) by creating auditable records of all privacy-impacting operations across Skald nodes and modules.

## Purpose
To provide a complete, immutable, and queryable audit trail of all user data access and privacy-relevant actions, enabling regulatory reporting, internal audits, and user-driven privacy rights enforcement (e.g., right to know, right to delete).

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Privacy Event Capture
- **User Data Access Event Logging:** Record all read, write, export, and deletion actions performed on user data.
- **Actor Attribution:** Log who accessed the data (user, admin, external API client).
- **Purpose Declaration:** Require logging of declared purpose for each data access (e.g., operational, research, compliance).
- **Data Subject Identification:** Tag each log entry with unique user or data subject identifiers.

### 2. Sensitive Action Tracking
- **Export Events:** Log all external data exports, including target destination and export scope.
- **Data Deletion Requests:** Record initiation, approval, and execution of data deletion workflows.
- **Anonymization Actions:** Track all data anonymization or masking operations.

### 3. Query and Reporting API
- **Subject Access Request API:** Allow generation of full data access history for a specific user or data subject.
- **Privacy Event Filters:** Filter logs by actor, data subject, action type, or time range.
- **Exportable Reports:** Provide CSV, JSON, and PDF exports of privacy event logs.

### 4. Retention and Redaction Policies
- **Privacy Log Retention Rules:** Support customizable retention durations for privacy logs.
- **Access-Controlled Log Viewing:** Only authorized privacy officers can view or export sensitive privacy logs.
- **Redaction Support:** Mask sensitive fields in logs during exports for external reporting.

### 5. Alerting and Compliance Hooks
- **Unusual Access Pattern Detection:** Trigger alerts for suspicious or non-compliant data access behaviors.
- **Breach Notification Integration:** Feed into incident response workflows for data breach reporting.
- **Compliance Report Generation:** Produce GDPR Article 30-style processing records.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Latency:** Sub-500ms write latency for privacy log entries.
- **Integrity:** Tamper-evident logging with cryptographic validation.
- **Scalability:** Support tracking of millions of data access events per day.
- **Security:** Full encryption and strict RBAC on all privacy log data.

## Data Flow Diagram (Textual)
1. **User Data Action → PDALL Logger → Immutable Privacy Log Store → Query API / Compliance Reporting / Alert System**

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** Skald Storage Modules (WSPE, HEARS, OASDL, LTMS), Admin Control Panel (ACP), External API Gateways.
- **Output Interfaces:** Admin Dashboard (DVL), Audit Report Generator (ARGEM), External Compliance Tools.

## Configuration Options
- **Retention Period:** Per jurisdictional requirement.
- **Export Redaction Profiles:** Customizable.
- **Unusual Access Thresholds:** For triggering alerts.
- **Subject Access Request Templates:** Per regulatory standard.

## Example Use Cases
- Generating a full access history for a user's Subject Access Request (SAR).
- Alerting security teams on excessive data export activity by a single admin.
- Exporting privacy logs for a GDPR Article 30 compliance review.
- Auditing historical deletion requests and their execution.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **Custom Privacy Event Types:** For organization-specific data access policies.
- **External SIEM Integration:** Push privacy logs into external monitoring tools.
- **Real-Time Anomaly Detection Engine Feed:** For advanced privacy breach detection.

## Testing and Validation Plan
- Data access event capture validation.
- SAR query correctness testing.
- Export redaction accuracy verification.
- Alert trigger and notification reliability tests.

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **All Skald Storage and Access Modules**
- **Admin Control Panel (ACP)**
- **Audit Logging and Compliance Engine (ALC)**
- **Audit Report Generation Module (ARGEM)**

## Future Enhancements
- AI-driven privacy risk scoring.
- Data minimization policy enforcement tracking.
- Natural language SAR report generator.
- Geo-fencing access policy enforcement logs.
