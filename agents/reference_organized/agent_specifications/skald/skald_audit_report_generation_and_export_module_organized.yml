# Skald Module Specification: Audit Report Generation and Export Module (ARGEM)

## Module Name
**Skald Audit Report Generation and Export Module (ARGEM)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Skald Audit Report Generation and Export Module (ARGEM) enables automated and on-demand generation of comprehensive, audit-grade reports covering system activity, compliance status, user actions, privacy events, security incidents, and SLA adherence across the Skald ecosystem. ARGEM centralizes reporting workflows and provides export capabilities in various auditor-friendly formats.

## Purpose
To provide Skald administrators, auditors, and compliance teams with a reliable, configurable, and secure system for producing legally and operationally mandated audit reports, ensuring internal governance and external regulatory compliance.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Report Types Supported
- **System-Wide Audit Trails:** Full logs of system, module, and user activities (from CALE).
- **SLA Compliance Reports:** SLA adherence rates, breach history, and risk trend summaries (from SCRD).
- **Privacy Access Logs:** Subject access reports and data processing activity logs (from PDALL).
- **Security Incident Reports:** Summaries of detected security incidents and response actions (from SEMAS).
- **Configuration Change Reports:** Detailed history of configuration modifications (from CVSM and CALE).

### 2. Report Generation Triggers
- **Scheduled Reports:** Daily, weekly, monthly, or custom-scheduled report jobs.
- **On-Demand Reports:** Immediate report generation triggered by admins or external API calls.
- **Compliance Event-Driven Reports:** Automatic generation in response to specific compliance triggers (e.g., SLA breach, SAR request).

### 3. Customizable Report Templates
- **Template Library:** Predefined report templates for common compliance frameworks (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, etc.).
- **Custom Report Builder:** Allow admins to design new report types using a drag-and-drop report query builder.
- **Field Selection and Filtering:** Configure which fields, time ranges, modules, and event types appear in each report.

### 4. Export Formats and Delivery
- **Export Formats:** Support for PDF, CSV, JSON, XML, and HTML.
- **Secure Delivery Channels:** Allow downloads via Admin Dashboard, email delivery, or export to external storage via ESIB.
- **Encryption at Rest and In Transit:** Apply end-to-end encryption for all exported reports.
- **Retention and Expiration Policies:** Optionally auto-delete old generated reports after a configured period.

### 5. Access Control and Auditability
- **Role-Based Report Access:** Restrict who can generate, view, or export specific report types.
- **Generation and Access Logging:** Log all report generation and viewing actions to CALE.
- **Watermarking and Tamper-Proofing:** Optionally watermark sensitive reports and apply digital signatures for authenticity verification.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Generate standard reports in under 30 seconds for typical data volumes.
- **Scalability:** Support batch report generation during peak audit periods.
- **Extensibility:** Easily add new report templates and data source connectors.
- **Compliance:** Ensure all generated reports meet audit standards for data integrity and traceability.

## Data Flow Diagram (Textual)
1. **Report Trigger → ARGEM Scheduler/Builder → Data Source Query Engine (CALE, SCRD, PDALL, SEMAS, etc.) → Report Formatter → Export Manager → Delivery / Download / External Storage**

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** Admin Dashboard (DVL), API Trigger Points, External Compliance Systems.
- **Output Interfaces:** Admin Dashboard (for download), External Storage Integration Broker (ESIB), Email Delivery Systems.

## Configuration Options
- **Default Report Schedule:** Per report type.
- **Export Format Defaults:** Per admin or tenant.
- **Retention Duration for Generated Reports:** Configurable.
- **Report Watermarking and Signature Options:** On/Off and template-specific.

## Example Use Cases
- Generating a quarterly GDPR Article 30 data processing report.
- Exporting all SLA breach summaries for a monthly customer report.
- Producing a Subject Access Request (SAR) report for a user inquiry.
- Automating daily system-wide audit trail exports for external SIEM archiving.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **Custom Data Source Connectors:** Integrate with external systems for multi-source reporting.
- **Dynamic Template Loader:** Allow runtime upload of new report templates.
- **Advanced Formatting Plugins:** For branded report layouts.

## Testing and Validation Plan
- Multi-format export validation.
- Report data accuracy benchmarking.
- Template customization tests.
- Access control enforcement verification.

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **Central Audit Logging Engine (CALE)**
- **SLA Compliance Dashboard (SCRD)**
- **Privacy Data Access Logging Layer (PDALL)**
- **Security Event Monitoring and Alert System (SEMAS)**
- **External Storage Integration Broker (ESIB)**
- **Admin Dashboard (DVL)**

## Future Enhancements
- Natural language report summary generation.
- AI-driven anomaly highlighting within reports.
- Regulatory compliance template packs (HIPAA, SOC 2, ISO 27001).
- Scheduled delivery to external auditors and compliance portals.
