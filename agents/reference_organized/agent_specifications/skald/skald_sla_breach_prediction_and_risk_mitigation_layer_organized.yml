# Skald Module Specification: SLA Breach Prediction and Risk Mitigation Layer (SLABPRM)

## Module Name
**Skald SLA Breach Prediction and Risk Mitigation Layer (SLABPRM)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Skald SLA Breach Prediction and Risk Mitigation Layer (SLABPRM) monitors runtime telemetry, historical workflow performance, and external load indicators to predict potential Service Level Agreement (SLA) breaches before they happen. It triggers proactive risk mitigation actions to prevent or minimize SLA violations.

## Purpose
To protect Skald system SLA compliance by forecasting breach risks and enabling automated or recommended mitigation strategies before deadlines, latency limits, or resource guarantees are violated.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. SLA Monitoring and Risk Scoring
- **Real-Time SLA Compliance Tracking:** Monitor ongoing workflow execution against SLA targets.
- **Breach Risk Scoring:** Calculate SLA breach probability scores using AI/ML risk models.
- **Multi-SLA Profile Support:** Support different SLA types (latency, uptime, response rate, error rate).

### 2. Breach Prediction Engine
- **Forecast Models:** Time-to-violation models using telemetry and load forecasts from RUPLFE.
- **Historical Failure Pattern Analysis:** Learn from past SLA breach incidents.
- **Load-Driven Breach Risk Calculation:** Adjust risk scores dynamically based on current and forecasted system load.

### 3. Risk Mitigation Action Engine
- **Proactive Routing Adjustments:** Signal AWRE to select faster execution paths.
- **Resource Pre-Allocation:** Notify Runtime Scheduler to reserve extra resources for at-risk workflows.
- **User Notification:** Alert users about workflows at high risk of SLA violation.
- **Workflow Throttling:** Reduce initiation rate of non-critical workflows during critical SLA windows.

### 4. Reporting and Dashboard Integration
- **SLA Risk Dashboards:** Display current risk levels across workflows and nodes.
- **Historical SLA Breach Reports:** Document all past SLA violations and mitigation attempts.
- **Live Alerts:** Send real-time notifications for workflows crossing risk thresholds.

### 5. Learning and Feedback Loop
- **Risk Model Retraining:** Update predictive models with new SLA outcome data.
- **Mitigation Effectiveness Tracking:** Measure success rates of past mitigation actions.
- **Admin Feedback Input:** Allow manual risk score adjustments and feedback.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Latency:** SLA risk scoring must complete within 50ms per workflow evaluation.
- **Scalability:** Track and score SLA risk for tens of thousands of concurrent workflows.
- **Extensibility:** Support for pluggable risk models.
- **Reliability:** Fail-safe default risk levels during SLABPRM outages.

## Data Flow Diagram (Textual)
1. **Workflow Execution Telemetry → SLABPRM Risk Analyzer → SLA Breach Predictor → Risk Mitigation Engine → Workflow Orchestrator / Admin Alerts / Dashboard Update**

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** Usage Metrics (UMAC), Resource Utilization Monitor (RUM), Workflow Orchestrator (SWO), Runtime Scheduler (SRS).
- **Output Interfaces:** Adaptive Workflow Routing Engine (AWRE), Admin Dashboards (DVL), Notification Systems, Audit Logging (ALC).

## Configuration Options
- **SLA Profiles:** Define SLA targets and thresholds.
- **Risk Thresholds:** Set probability cutoffs for triggering mitigation.
- **Notification Settings:** Per workflow, user, or SLA type.
- **Model Retraining Frequency:** Scheduled or on-demand.

## Example Use Cases
- Preemptively rerouting a high-latency workflow to avoid SLA breach.
- Alerting users when their request is at risk of missing a guaranteed response time.
- Scaling up compute resources in advance of forecasted load surges.
- Throttling non-critical API calls during near-breach conditions.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **Custom SLA Models:** For domain-specific SLA types.
- **Third-Party SLA Management Integration:** Sync with external SLA monitoring tools.
- **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment API:** Allow real-time risk policy changes.

## Testing and Validation Plan
- SLA breach prediction accuracy tests.
- Mitigation action effectiveness tracking.
- Load spike simulation testing.
- Failure and rollback scenario validation.

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **Usage Metrics and Analytics Collector (UMAC)**
- **Resource Utilization Monitor (RUM)**
- **Workflow Orchestrator (SWO)**
- **Runtime Scheduler (SRS)**
- **Admin Control Panel (ACP)**
- **Dashboard and Visualization Layer (DVL)**

## Future Enhancements
- Reinforcement learning-driven SLA risk models.
- SLA contract-aware dynamic mitigation policies.
- Multi-tenant SLA risk segmentation.
- SLA breach financial impact estimators.
