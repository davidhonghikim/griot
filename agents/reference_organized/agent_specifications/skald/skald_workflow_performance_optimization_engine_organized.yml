# Skald Module Specification: Workflow Performance Optimization Engine (WPOE)

## Module Name
**Skald Workflow Performance Optimization Engine (WPOE)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Skald Workflow Performance Optimization Engine (WPOE) analyzes historical and real-time workflow execution metrics to dynamically optimize workflow configurations, execution paths, resource allocations, and module scheduling. WPOE leverages AI/ML models to detect performance bottlenecks and suggest or apply runtime adjustments for improved throughput and reduced latency.

## Purpose
To continuously monitor, learn from, and optimize Skald workflow execution patterns for improved speed, efficiency, and system utilization across varying load conditions and workflow types.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Workflow Execution Data Collection
- **Performance Metrics:** Capture execution time, queue time, module processing time, resource usage per workflow.
- **Bottleneck Detection:** Identify modules or stages causing latency spikes.
- **Failure Pattern Logging:** Track workflows with high error or retry rates.

### 2. Optimization Recommendation Engine
- **AI/ML-Based Predictive Models:** Predict performance-impacting factors (e.g., upcoming load spikes, module contention).
- **Dynamic Workflow Parameter Tuning:** Adjust runtime parameters like concurrency levels, timeout thresholds, or batch sizes.
- **Workflow Path Optimization:** Suggest or auto-adjust execution paths to skip unnecessary steps under certain conditions.
- **Resource Allocation Adjustments:** Propose CPU, memory, or I/O allocation changes for modules.

### 3. Runtime Auto-Tuning
- **Real-Time Feedback Loop:** Apply optimizations dynamically during workflow execution (where allowed).
- **Safe Mode Option:** Allow recommendation-only mode or full auto-tuning mode.
- **Rollback Mechanisms:** Revert tuning adjustments if performance degrades.

### 4. Reporting and Dashboards
- **Optimization Action Logs:** Record all recommendations, applied changes, and resulting performance impacts.
- **Performance Trend Dashboards:** Visualize historical workflow performance improvements over time.
- **Before/After Comparison Tools:** Provide comparative metrics for admin review.

### 5. Extensibility and Model Updates
- **Pluggable AI Models:** Allow swapping out optimization models.
- **Continuous Learning Pipeline:** Retrain optimization models using fresh execution data.
- **Custom Optimization Rules:** Support admin-defined manual tuning rules.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Latency Impact:** Optimization decision latency must stay under 20ms per workflow evaluation.
- **Scalability:** Support analysis of thousands of concurrent workflows.
- **Extensibility:** Modular optimization model framework.
- **Reliability:** Ensure system stability during auto-tuning adjustments.

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** Workflow Execution Metrics, Resource Utilization Monitor (RUM), Admin Control Panel (ACP).
- **Output Interfaces:** Skald Runtime Scheduler (SRS), Admin Dashboards, Audit Logging (ALC).

## Configuration Options
- **Auto-Tuning Mode:** Off / Suggest Only / Full Auto-Tune.
- **Optimization Frequency:** Per workflow / Scheduled interval.
- **Performance Thresholds:** Customizable trigger points.
- **Model Refresh Interval:** For AI model retraining.

## Example Use Cases
- Dynamically increasing concurrency for a burst of short, low-cost workflows.
- Reducing memory allocation for rarely-used modules.
- Automatically skipping unnecessary validation steps on low-risk workflows.
- Notifying admins about a sudden degradation in average workflow latency.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **Custom Optimization Plugins:** For organization-specific tuning rules.
- **AI Model Swap API:** Allow replacing optimization models.
- **Integration with SLA Monitoring:** For SLA-driven tuning triggers.

## Testing and Validation Plan
- Tuning recommendation accuracy tests.
- Load tests under different auto-tuning modes.
- Safety and rollback validation.
- AI model drift detection testing.

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **Skald Workflow Orchestrator (SWO)**
- **Resource Utilization Monitor (RUM)**
- **Audit Logging and Compliance Engine (ALC)**
- **Admin Control Panel (ACP)**

## Future Enhancements
- AI-driven pre-emptive scaling for upcoming load spikes.
- Visualization of optimization decision paths.
- Reinforcement learning-based performance tuning.
- Integration with external observability platforms.
