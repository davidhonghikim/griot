# Skald Phase 14 - Module 11: Multi-Layer Ethical Escalation and Arbitration System (MLEEAS)

## Node Class: Skald (Communication & Expression)

## Phase 14 Focus:
Structured Multi-Agent and Human-in-the-Loop Escalation for Complex Ethical Conflicts

---

## 1. Module Overview
The **Multi-Layer Ethical Escalation and Arbitration System (MLEEAS)** provides Skald agents with a robust, multi-stage escalation and resolution framework for handling high-risk, ethically ambiguous, or unresolved ethical conflicts detected during content generation.

MLEEAS manages ethical decision escalations across agents, system modules, andâ€”when configuredâ€”human oversight layers. It ensures traceable, auditable, and consensus-driven conflict resolution for sensitive content outputs.

---

## 2. Primary Functions

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Automated Risk Threshold Trigger Engine** | Monitors outputs for risk scores exceeding predefined thresholds from ECCDE, STHE, or GEPDE. |
| **Multi-Agent Consensus Layer** | Engages a quorum of Skald agents (or other kOS node classes) to vote on ethical conflict resolutions. |
| **Human-in-the-Loop Escalation Pathway** | Provides mechanisms to route flagged content to designated human moderators, reviewers, or compliance officers. |
| **Context-Aware Resolution Framework** | Determines the most appropriate escalation path based on content type, audience, jurisdiction, and risk category. |
| **Arbitration Decision Engine** | Consolidates agent votes, human decisions, and policy rules to produce a final arbitration decision. |
| **Decision Timeboxing Controller** | Applies time limits to escalation stages to prevent bottlenecks in high-throughput systems. |
| **Audit and Traceability Layer** | Logs every step of the escalation, arbitration, and decision process for compliance, legal, and governance review. |
| **Override Authorization Manager** | Manages which roles or agents have authority to override previous ethical decisions during arbitration. |

---

## 3. Data Inputs

| Input | Source |
| --- | --- |
| **Escalation Triggers** | From ECCDE, STHE, RHGL, ETLAE, or GEPDE |
| **Conflict Metadata and Risk Scores** | From upstream decision logs |
| **Active Ethical Policies and Jurisdictional Rules** | From GEPDE and CCETL |
| **Agent Consensus Profiles** | Configured at deployment or runtime |

---

## 4. Data Outputs

| Output | Destination |
| --- | --- |
| **Final Arbitration Decision Record** | Sent downstream to GEPDE and kOS Global Audit Layer |
| **Override Approval/Denial Logs** | Archived for audit review |
| **Escalation Resolution Metadata** | Included with final content output package |
| **Human Review Feedback (If Applicable)** | Stored for future learning loops (EFLL) |

---

## 5. Processing Pipeline

1. Receive escalation trigger with conflict metadata
2. Evaluate applicable escalation paths (automated consensus vs human review)
3. Trigger agent quorum voting if required
4. Route to human reviewer if configured and necessary
5. Consolidate votes, human input, and ethical policy rules
6. Apply Arbitration Decision Logic
7. Generate final decision, including rationale and audit annotations
8. Forward to GEPDE for final ethics validation pass

---

## 6. Escalation Path Types

| Path Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Automated Multi-Agent Consensus** | System-selected quorum of Skald or other kOS agents vote on resolution |
| **Human Moderator Review** | Designated human reviewers provide decision input via dashboard or API |
| **Hybrid Path** | Combines agent voting with human final approval step |
| **Auto-Resolve (Low Risk)** | Automatically apply the most conservative resolution for low-severity conflicts |

---

## 7. Deployment Options

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Escalation Risk Thresholds** | Configurable risk score triggers for each escalation path |
| **Agent Quorum Size and Selection Rules** | Define number and type of agents involved in consensus decisions |
| **Human Reviewer API Endpoints** | Integrate with external compliance dashboards or review systems |
| **Decision Time Limits** | Apply per-stage timeboxing to avoid indefinite escalation states |
| **Override Authority Roles** | Configure which agents or human roles can override automated decisions |

---

## 8. Governance Hooks

- Escalation frequency tracking
- Resolution decision accuracy scoring
- Human reviewer performance and bias monitoring
- Multi-agent quorum health checks
- Audit trail export for legal or organizational oversight

---

## 9. Example Use Case Scenarios

| Scenario | MLEEAS Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Content flagged as politically sensitive and violating two jurisdictional policies** | Trigger multi-agent review followed by human arbitration |
| **Ethical contradiction with unclear resolution path** | Invoke full agent quorum vote with weighted ethical rule prioritization |
| **Humor module flagged for potential cultural offense in multiple regions** | Route to human cultural review panel for final decision |
| **High-risk trauma content flagged during educational module generation** | Auto-escalate to human safety reviewer before release |
| **Low-risk tone inconsistency** | Auto-resolve using conservative tone adjustment without escalation |

---

## 10. Module Integration Points

| Module | Integration |
| --- | --- |
| **GEPDE** | Receives final arbitration decisions for ethics pass-through |
| **ECCDE** | Supplies conflict and contradiction risk scores |
| **CASF** | Provides audience risk data influencing escalation path choice |
| **EFLL (Module 13)** | Receives feedback loop data from human review outcomes |
| **kOS Global Audit Layer** | Archives all escalation and arbitration logs |

---

## 11. Future Roadmap

- AI-powered consensus fairness scoring models
- Human reviewer bias drift detection
- Adaptive quorum formation algorithms based on past decision accuracy
- Time-based escalation prioritization models
