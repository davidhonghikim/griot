# Skald Phase 14 - Module 7: Ethical Content Warning and Disclaimer Generator (ECWDG)

## Node Class: Skald (Communication & Expression)

## Phase 14 Focus:
Automated Audience-Appropriate Content Warnings and Ethical Disclaimers

---

## 1. Module Overview
The **Ethical Content Warning and Disclaimer Generator (ECWDG)** provides Skald agents with a real-time system for generating, formatting, and attaching audience-appropriate content warnings, disclaimers, and ethical transparency statements to outputs that warrant them.

It ensures that users and audiences are adequately informed of potentially sensitive, controversial, or contextually significant content elements prior to engagement.

ECWDG acts as the final-stage notification layer between content generation and audience delivery.

---

## 2. Primary Functions

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Content Risk Tag Parser** | Reads upstream risk annotations from modules like STHE, RHGL, and CASF to determine if a warning is required. |
| **Audience Sensitivity Cross-Checker** | Verifies which types of warnings are relevant based on audience profile and jurisdiction. |
| **Disclaimer Template Loader** | Accesses predefined, customizable disclaimer templates based on content type, risk category, and audience language. |
| **Dynamic Disclaimer Generator** | Assembles customized warnings and disclaimers in real-time, tailored to the output format (text, audio, visual, etc.). |
| **Language and Tone Adjuster** | Ensures that disclaimers themselves are clear, non-alarmist, but ethically sufficient to inform users. |
| **Placement and Formatting Engine** | Determines where and how the warning/disclaimer is attached or presented (before content, inline, at end, etc.). |
| **Compliance Logging Module** | Records all disclaimer generation actions and final attached warnings for audit and compliance tracking. |

---

## 3. Data Inputs

| Input | Source |
| --- | --- |
| **Risk Annotations and Flags** | From STHE, RHGL, ETLAE, CASF, and GEPDE |
| **Audience Profile Metadata** | From CASF and Contextual Trigger Engine |
| **Jurisdictional Compliance Data** | From GEPDE |
| **Disclaimer Template Repository** | Local or organization-specific template library |

---

## 4. Data Outputs

| Output | Destination |
| --- | --- |
| **Content Warning / Disclaimer Block** | Prepended, appended, or inlined with final Skald content output |
| **Metadata Annotations** | For downstream rendering engines or API consumers to parse |
| **Audit Log Entry** | Sent to kOS Global Audit Layer |

---

## 5. Processing Pipeline

1. Parse risk annotations and audience profile
2. Cross-check against audience sensitivity settings and jurisdictional requirements
3. Load appropriate disclaimer or warning templates
4. Generate customized warning/disclaimer text
5. Attach and format the warning within the final content package
6. Generate audit trail for disclaimer action

---

## 6. Disclaimer Types and Formats

| Type | Example Context |
| --- | --- |
| **Content Warning** | Graphic violence, strong language, trauma-related content |
| **Ethical Disclaimer** | AI-generated content notice, bias risk statement |
| **Jurisdictional Compliance Notice** | Age restrictions, regional speech laws |
| **Humor Risk Disclaimer** | For humor modules when tone may be misinterpreted |
| **Educational Contextualization Note** | When content discusses controversial historical or social topics |

---

## 7. Deployment Options

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Default Disclaimer Packs** | Provided for common risk categories and output types |
| **Custom Organizational Templates** | Enterprises can upload or mandate custom disclaimers |
| **User Preference Integration** | Allow users to opt-in/out of certain disclaimer types (if allowed by org policy) |
| **Dynamic Placement Rules** | Configure where warnings appear (pre-content, pop-up, inline, etc.) |

---

## 8. Governance Hooks

- Template version control and update auditing
- Compliance audits for missing or insufficient disclaimers
- Human review triggers for borderline disclaimer cases
- Periodic effectiveness reviews for disclaimer clarity and user understanding

---

## 9. Example Use Case Scenarios

| **AI-generated legal advisory response** | Append AI-generated content disclaimer |
| **Political satire humor content** | Insert humor risk and satire disclaimer |
| **Multilingual educational material on colonial history** | Attach cultural sensitivity note and educational disclaimer |
