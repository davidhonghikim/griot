# kOS Orchestration Engine Specification

## Overview

The **kOS Orchestration Engine** is the central processing and control layer of the Kind AI OS ecosystem. It acts as the "brain" of the system, responsible for interpreting user inputs, selecting appropriate recipes, coordinating agent behaviors, executing skills, managing adapters, enforcing ethical filters, and delivering outputs to users.

---

## Core Responsibilities

| Responsibility | Description |
|---|---|
| **Intent Parsing** | Translates natural language user input into structured intents and parameters. |
| **Recipe Selection** | Matches user intent to a suitable recipe from the Recipe Registry based on trigger phrases, context, and user history. |
| **Skill Execution Management** | Orchestrates the step-by-step execution of each skill in the recipe, handling dependencies, parallelization, and error management. |
| **Adapter Invocation** | Communicates with external APIs, local tools, or internal services via the Adapter Layer for actual task execution. |
| **Agent Coordination** | Triggers specific agents (Skald, Junzi, GAL, etc.) to fulfill domain-specific tasks. |
| **Context Tracking** | Maintains conversation state, session memory, and user-specific preferences for multi-step workflows. |
| **Ethics Enforcement** | Runs outputs and decisions through the Ethics Layer (HIEROS + Junzi) before final delivery. |
| **Multi-Source Aggregation** | When required, gathers outputs from multiple LLMs or tools and runs them through the Distillation Module for synthesis. |
| **Logging & Telemetry** | Records execution traces, performance metrics, and decision paths for Meta-Learning and optimization. |

---

## High-Level Workflow

1. **User Input Received:** Via text, voice, or API call.
2. **Intent Parsing:** NLP-driven intent recognition and parameter extraction.
3. **Recipe Matching:** Look up matching recipes based on triggers and context.
4. **Ethical Pre-Check (optional):** For sensitive tasks, run a pre-screening through Junzi Ethics Layer.
5. **Skill Chain Execution:**
   - For each step:
     - Select appropriate adapter and skill
     - Run action
     - Capture output or handle errors
6. **Multi-Agent Invocation:** Trigger multiple agents for roundtable auditing or subtask delegation.
7. **Distillation (if multi-source):** Aggregate and reconcile responses from multiple tools/agents.
8. **Ethical Post-Check:** Final ethical filter pass.
9. **Output Delivery:** Return result to user with optional explanation, source trace, or confidence score.
10. **Telemetry & Logging:** Store full execution trace for auditing and meta-learning.

## Internal Modules

| Module | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Intent Parser** | NLP-based user input classifier and slot filler. |
| **Recipe Resolver** | Fetches appropriate recipe from the Recipe Registry. |
| **Skill Executor** | Runs individual skills, handles retries, monitors step execution. |
| **Adapter Router** | Directs skill execution requests to correct adapters. |
| **Agent Dispatcher** | Notifies and coordinates specialized agents for tasks. |
| **Context Manager** | Maintains session state, user preferences, and variable storage. |
| **Ethics Filter** | Enforces system-wide ethical constraints. |
| **Distillation Engine** | Synthesizes multi-agent or multi-LLM outputs into unified response. |
| **Telemetry Logger** | Captures execution metrics, errors, and user feedback for analysis. |

---

## Deployment Modes

| Mode | Description |
|---|---|
| **Local Node Mode** | Runs fully on user hardware (laptop, server, Pi, etc.). |
| **Cloud Hybrid Mode** | Mixes local execution with external API calls (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic). |
| **Federated Node Mode** | Coordinates with other kOS nodes in distributed networks. |
| **Privacy-First Mode** | Restricts execution to fully local, non-cloud-dependent workflows. |

---

## Fault Tolerance & Error Handling

- Step-level error recovery
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Fallback recipes for failure scenarios
- Ethical rejection handling (when a recipe violates ethical constraints)
- Graceful degradation when external services are unavailable

---

## Performance Metrics Captured

| Metric | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Step Latency | Measure execution time per skill step |
| Adapter Call Success Rate | Monitor reliability of external services |
| Error Frequency | Track stability issues |
| User Feedback | Capture satisfaction ratings per execution |
| Cost Tracking | Record API token and compute cost per execution |

---

## Extensibility

- New recipes, skills, and adapters can be added without touching core engine logic.
- Dynamic loading of agent modules based on available Node Classes.
- Pluggable NLP models for Intent Parsing.
- Configurable ethics profiles for different deployment environments.

---

## Security Considerations

- Input sanitization for all user inputs.
- Output filtering to prevent data leakage.
- API key encryption for external adapters.
- User authentication and permissions per execution.
- Audit trail logging for sensitive actions.

---

## Next Steps for Development

- Build base orchestration engine skeleton in Python.
- Integrate with initial Adapter Layer (OpenAI, Ollama, Slack, etc.).
- Implement Recipe Resolver and Skill Executor modules.
- Connect to Ethics Layer for gating sensitive outputs.
- Set up Context Manager with session memory storage.
- Develop logging and telemetry service.
