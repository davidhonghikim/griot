# JUNZI Phase 6 - Detailed Technical Specification: AI-Ethics Co-Governance Interface (AECGI)

## Module Name:

AI-Ethics Co-Governance Interface (AECGI)

## Module Purpose:

AECGI enables designated AI entities within the JUNZI network to participate in governance processes as non-voting, advisory stakeholders. This interface ensures AI systems can provide insight, predictive analytics, ethical impact projections, and historical pattern analysis during governance deliberations while preventing direct decision-making control.

---

## System Architecture

### AI-Governance Participation Pipeline:

1. **AI Stakeholder Registry:**

   - Maintains profiles for approved AI governance participants.
   - Attributes include:
     - AI type (LLM, ML Model, Expert System)
     - Designated advisory domain (e.g., Risk, Sentiment, Drift)
     - Participation scope limits

2. **Proposal Analysis Engine:**

   - Allows AI entities to:
     - Analyze pending SVN proposals
     - Run impact simulations via PASv2
     - Access ethical pattern summaries from EPR
     - Retrieve historical governance outcomes from ELTE and EKB

3. **Advisory Report Generator:**

   - Produces standardized AI advisory responses including:
     - Predicted stakeholder sentiment shifts
     - Risk exposure deltas
     - Rule conflict forecasts

4. **Governance Communication API:**

   - Allows AI-generated advisory reports to be attached to:
     - SVN proposal discussions
     - Governance board review processes

5. **Non-Voting Enforcement Layer:**

   - Ensures AECGI APIs cannot submit votes or trigger rule changes.
   - Provides read-and-analyze-only API scope for AI agents.

6. **Audit and Transparency Layer:**

   - Logs all AI governance interactions into EAT.
   - Tags each advisory response with AI source, version, and rationale generation method.

## Data Models

### AI Governance Advisory Record:

```json
{
  "advisory_id": "uuid",
  "ai_entity_id": "uuid",
  "proposal_id": "uuid",
  "analysis_summary": "string",
  "impact_forecast": "JSON",
  "sentiment_projection": "JSON",
  "generated_at": "ISO8601",
  "linked_data_sources": ["PASv2", "EPR", "ELTE", "EKB"]
}
```

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint                                     | Method | Description                                         |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| /aecgi/get-proposal-context/{proposal\_id}   | GET    | Returns data for AI analysis (read-only)            |
| /aecgi/submit-advisory/{proposal\_id}        | POST   | Submits AI advisory report to governance discussion |
| /aecgi/get-advisory-history/{ai\_entity\_id} | GET    | Lists past AI advisory contributions                |
| /aecgi/get-data-access-log/{ai\_entity\_id}  | POST   | Returns AI’s data retrieval history for audit       |

---

## Algorithms and Logic

1. **Advisory Report Summarization:**

   - NLP-based summarization of impact analysis and risk forecasting.

2. **Participation Scope Enforcement:**

   - API-level RBAC and scope tokens ensuring non-voting AI role compliance.

3. **Transparency Tagging:**

   - Attaches AI source, model version, and confidence scores to each advisory.

---

## Performance Targets

- **Proposal Context Access Latency:** Under 1 second
- **Advisory Report Generation Time:** Under 5 minutes per proposal
- **Non-Voting API Call Error Rate:** 0% (strict policy enforcement)

---

## Monitoring and Metrics

- **AI Advisory Submission Rate**
- **Average Advisory Processing Time**
- **Data Access Volume Per AI**
- **Governance Feedback on AI Advice Utility**

Monitoring Tools: Prometheus + Grafana; AI Governance Participation dashboards.

---

## Security Considerations

- Strict API scoping to prevent unauthorized actions
- AI identity verification on every API call
- Version tracking of advisory-generating models
- Full audit trail of all AI governance activities

---

## Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests:**

  - Scope enforcement logic
  - Advisory data formatting

- **Integration Tests:**

  - AECGI ↔ SVN, PASv2, EPR, ELTE, EKB, EAT data access and report submission flows

- **Load Tests:**

  - High-volume advisory generation under multiple concurrent proposals

- **Security Tests:**

  - Non-voting scope violation simulations

---

## Deployment Profile

- **Language:** Python 3.11
- **Containerization:** Docker + Kubernetes
- **Storage:** PostgreSQL for advisory records; S3 for advisory artifacts

---

## Dependencies

- SVN API
- PASv2 API
- EPR API
- ELTE API
- EKB API
- EAT API
