# kOS Deployment Installer Script and Config

## Overview
The **kOS Deployment Installer Script and Config (DISC)** provides the standardized automation toolset for deploying the entire kOS ecosystem, including nodes, agents, orchestration layers, and system services. It ensures consistent, repeatable, and configurable deployments across local, cloud, and hybrid environments.

## Installer Components

| Component                  | Purpose                                      |
|---------------------- |------------------------------------------- |
| Installer Script (CLI) | Automate installation of all core services, dependencies, and modules |
| Config File Template   | Define deployment parameters, Node Class role, network settings, and environment variables |
| Dependency Resolver    | Auto-check and install missing system packages and runtime dependencies |
| Ethics Pre-Deployment Checker | Run JUNZI ethics filters against planned deployment configuration |
| Post-Install Validation Suite | Confirm installation success and environment readiness |

---

## Supported Deployment Targets

| Target Environment      | Example Platforms                          |
|-------------------- |----------------------------------- |
| Local Development Node | Desktop or laptop-based installs        |
| Edge Devices          | Raspberry Pi, Android, ARM-based systems |
| Private Cluster        | On-premise data centers or lab networks  |
| Public Cloud Instances | AWS, GCP, Azure                          |
| Mesh Networks          | LoRa or WiFi Direct deployments          |

---

## Installer Workflow

1. **Pre-Check:** Validate system requirements (OS version, storage, network access)
2. **Dependency Installation:** Install Python, Docker, Kubernetes tools, etc.
3. **Node Class Declaration:** Require user to select or auto-detect Node Class for the node
4. **Download kOS Packages:** Pull all relevant agents, modules, and core services
5. **Environment Configuration:** Apply user-defined settings from config file
6. **Ethics Compliance Check:** JUNZI scan on deployment plan
7. **Service Startup:** Launch all required background services
8. **Post-Deploy Test Suite:** Validate service health and agent responsiveness

## Config File Structure (`kos_deploy.yaml`)

| Config Field         | Purpose                                      |
|------------------ |------------------------------------------ |
| `node_class`       | One of the 13 official Node Classes        |
| `network_mode`     | Offline / Mesh / Cloud / Hybrid           |
| `api_port`         | API server port number                    |
| `data_directory`   | Path for storage and logs                 |
| `enable_ssl`       | True/False for TLS support               |
| `orchestrator_url` | For multi-node deployments                |
| `ethics_profile`   | Select ethics filter sensitivity level    |
| `skills_to_preload`| List of skill IDs to install at setup     |
| `logging_level`    | INFO / DEBUG / ERROR                      |

---

## Security Safeguards

| Safeguard             | Description                                  |
|----------------- |-------------------------------------- |
| Config File Validation | Prevent invalid or malicious config injection |
| Installer Signature Check | Validate installer integrity before execution |
| Ethics Policy Lock-In | Enforce ethics settings before deployment begins |
| Role-Based Execution | Installer must run with sufficient but not excessive system privileges |

---

## CLI Commands (Example)

| Command                     | Purpose                                |
|---------------------- |---------------------------------- |
| `kos install`          | Full deployment from scratch     |
| `kos config --generate` | Create new deployment config template |
| `kos validate`          | Run pre-install dependency and ethics check |
| `kos start`             | Launch all kOS services          |
| `kos stop`              | Gracefully shut down services    |
| `kos uninstall`         | Remove all installed components |

---

## Extensibility

- Support for air-gapped / offline deployment modes
- Pluggable hooks for post-install custom scripts
- AI-assisted deployment parameter optimization (future phase)
- Federation-aware multi-node installer orchestration

---

The **kOS Deployment Installer Script and Config (DISC)** ensures that every kOS deployment—whether single-node or distributed cluster—is fast, secure, ethically compliant, and fully reproducible across all target environments and Node Classes.
