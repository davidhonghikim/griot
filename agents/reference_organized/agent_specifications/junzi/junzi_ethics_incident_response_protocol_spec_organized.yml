# JUNZI Phase 3 - Detailed Technical Specification: Ethical Incident Response Protocol (EIRP)

## Module Name:

Ethical Incident Response Protocol (EIRP)

## Module Purpose:

The EIRP defines the procedures, workflows, triggers, escalation paths, and response mechanisms JUNZI will follow when an ethical failure, breach, or critical ethical anomaly is detected during external pilot operations. It ensures rapid mitigation, transparency, stakeholder notification, and ethical system integrity restoration.

---

## System Architecture

### Incident Response Workflow Pipeline:

1. **Incident Detection Layer:**

   - Real-time triggers from:
     - EDM (ethical drift threshold breach)
     - RAME (critical risk event)
     - JEDE (unresolvable conflict or fatal error)
     - SFL (high-severity stakeholder objection)
     - Monitoring Dashboards (manual trigger by ethics operators)

2. **Incident Classification Engine:**

   - Categorizes incident severity:

     - Low
     - Medium
     - High
     - Critical

   - Classification factors:

     - Stakeholder harm potential
     - Rule violation severity
     - System stability impact

3. **Escalation Workflow Controller:**

   - Defines escalation paths based on severity:
     - Auto-mitigation
     - Internal ethics team notification
     - External Ethics Council review
     - System-wide emergency rollback

4. **Response Execution Layer:**

   - Executes mitigation actions:
     - Rule rollback (via DERE)
     - Decision flow halt (JEDE override)
     - Consent revocation notifications (via CTI)
     - Public stakeholder alerts (optional)

5. **Communication and Notification Layer:**

   - Automated notifications:
     - Email/SMS to Ethics Response Team
     - API push to external monitoring systems
     - In-dashboard alert popups

6. **Incident Logging Layer:**

   - Full incident history captured in EAT
   - Includes detection source, classification reason, response actions, and resolution status

7. **Post-Incident Review Engine:**

   - Automatically schedules ethics post-mortems for Critical and High incidents
   - Generates Incident Summary Reports
   - Suggests rule or policy adjustments for future prevention

## Data Models

### Ethical Incident Record:

```json
{
  "incident_id": "uuid",
  "detection_source": "EDM | RAME | JEDE | SFL | Dashboard",
  "severity": "Low | Medium | High | Critical",
  "trigger_event_id": "uuid",
  "classification_reason": "string",
  "mitigation_actions": ["string"],
  "escalation_path": "string",
  "status": "Open | In Progress | Resolved | Escalated",
  "created_at": "ISO8601",
  "resolved_at": "ISO8601 (optional)"
}
```

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint                          | Method | Description                                         |
| --------------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| /eirp/report-incident             | POST   | Allows modules or operators to report new incidents |
| /eirp/get-incident/{incident\_id} | GET    | Returns incident details and status                 |
| /eirp/escalate/{incident\_id}     | POST   | Triggers manual escalation                          |
| /eirp/resolve/{incident\_id}      | POST   | Marks incident as resolved                          |
| /eirp/incident-history            | POST   | Returns filtered incident logs for audit or review  |

---

## Escalation Policy

| Severity | Escalation Path                                                                      |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Low      | Auto-mitigation with EAT logging                                                     |
| Medium   | Ethics Operations Team notified for manual review                                    |
| High     | Immediate cross-team ethics review and temporary system freeze on affected modules   |
| Critical | Full system rollback, external stakeholder notification, Ethics Council intervention |

## Performance Targets

- **Incident Detection-to-Classification Latency:** Under 30 seconds
- **Critical Incident Response Time:** Under 5 minutes
- **Post-Incident Report Generation:** Within 1 hour of resolution

---

## Monitoring and Metrics

- **Incident Frequency Rate (by category)**
- **Average Resolution Time**
- **Escalation Rate by Severity**
- **False Positive Incident Rate**

Monitoring Tools: Prometheus + Grafana; EAT-linked incident audit dashboards.

---

## Security Considerations

- RBAC for incident trigger and resolution endpoints
- Incident data encryption
- Audit trail for all actions taken on incidents
- Rate limiting on public-facing API triggers

---

## Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests:**

  - Classification engine logic
  - Escalation path triggers

- **Integration Tests:**

  - EIRP â†” JEDE, DERE, CTI, EDM, RAME workflows

- **Load Tests:**

  - Multiple concurrent incident triggers

- **Recovery Simulation Tests:**

  - Full rollback simulation for Critical incidents

---

## Deployment Profile

- **Language:** Python 3.11 or Node.js 18+
- **Containerization:** Docker + Kubernetes
- **Storage:** PostgreSQL or MongoDB for incident records

---

## Dependencies

- JEDE API
- DERE API
- CTI API
- EDM API
- RAME API
- EAT API
