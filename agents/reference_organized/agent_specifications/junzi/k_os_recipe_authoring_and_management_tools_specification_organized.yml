# kOS Recipe Authoring and Management Tools Specification

## Overview

The **Recipe Authoring and Management Tools** provide developers, agents, and users with the ability to create, validate, modify, and deploy new Recipes within the kOS ecosystem. Recipes define **multi-step workflows** that chain Skills, Adapters, and Agent actions into executable task flows.

These tools enable rapid expansion of kOS functionality without requiring core system code changes.

---

## Core Responsibilities

| Responsibility | Description |
|---|---|
| **Recipe Authoring** | Create new multi-step task workflows that chain Skills and Adapters. |
| **Recipe Validation** | Check recipes for schema correctness, dependency resolution, and ethical safety. |
| **Recipe Versioning** | Track and manage version history for each recipe. |
| **Recipe Publishing** | Make recipes available to the Orchestration Engine for runtime use. |
| **Recipe Discovery** | Enable agents and users to search and browse available recipes. |
| **Recipe Deprecation** | Allow graceful sunsetting of outdated or replaced recipes. |
| **Ethics Pre-Screening** | Automatically scan recipes for potential ethical conflicts before publication. |

---

## Supported Recipe Formats

| Format | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **YAML** | Human-readable authoring format. |
| **JSON** | For programmatic storage and API access. |
| **Natural Language Templates (optional future phase)** | Let users describe workflows conversationally for auto-conversion into Recipes. |

---

## Recipe Metadata Schema

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `recipe_name` | Unique identifier. |
| `version` | Semantic version number (e.g., 1.0.1). |
| `author` | User or agent who created the recipe. |
| `description` | Short explanation of the workflow goal. |
| `trigger_phrases` | NLP phrases that trigger this recipe. |
| `steps` | Ordered list of skills to execute, with input mappings. |
| `dependencies` | List of required Skills, Adapters, Node Classes. |
| `node_class_alignment` | Which Node Class (from official 13 cultural classes) primarily owns execution. |
| `ethical_risk_score` | Calculated risk score from Junzi pre-check. |
| `tags` | Searchable classification terms (e.g., summarization, notification, SEO). |

---

## Recipe Authoring Tools (CLI & API)

| Tool | Function |
|---|---|
| `kos-recipe create` | Initialize a new recipe scaffold. |
| `kos-recipe validate {filename}` | Run schema and dependency checks. |
| `kos-recipe publish {filename}` | Register recipe into active registry. |
| `kos-recipe list` | View all available recipes. |
| `kos-recipe search --tag {tag}` | Search recipes by tag or function. |
| `kos-recipe inspect {recipe_name}` | View full recipe definition. |
| `kos-recipe deprecate {recipe_name}` | Mark recipe as deprecated. |
| `kos-recipe test-run {recipe_name}` | Run a sandboxed test execution for debugging. |

---

## Recipe Validation Criteria

| Check | Description |
|---|---|
| Syntax Compliance | Proper YAML/JSON formatting. |
| Skill Existence | All referenced Skills must exist and be active. |
| Adapter Availability | Required Adapters must be configured and reachable. |
| Node Class Alignment | Each recipe must have a designated Node Class owner. |
| Ethical Safety | Pre-checked by Junzi for known ethical risks. |
| Execution Sandbox Test | Optional dry-run validation to catch runtime errors. |

---

## Recipe Authoring Flow

1. **Author defines recipe in YAML or JSON.**
2. **Run `kos-recipe validate`.**
3. **Fix any schema or dependency errors.**
4. **Run `kos-recipe test-run` for execution sanity check.**
5. **Publish recipe with `kos-recipe publish`.**
6. **Recipe now becomes available to Orchestration Engine and Agents.**

---

## Extensibility & Future Enhancements

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| Visual Recipe Builder | Drag-and-drop web UI for recipe construction. |
| Natural Language Recipe Authoring | Auto-generate YAML recipes from plain English task descriptions. |
| Recipe Performance Scoring | Track usage frequency, average execution time, and user satisfaction. |
| Federated Recipe Sharing | Optional cross-node recipe sharing in federated deployments. |
| Multi-LLM Testing Mode | Allow recipe dry-runs across multiple LLM backends for optimization. |

---

## Next Steps for Development

- Implement core CLI tools.
- Build Recipe Registry API endpoints for recipe CRUD operations.
- Integrate with Junzi for ethics checks.
- Develop Recipe Test Sandbox.
- Link Recipe Authoring tools to Skill Registry for dependency lookups.
