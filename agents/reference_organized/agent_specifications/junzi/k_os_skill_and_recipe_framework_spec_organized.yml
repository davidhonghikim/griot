# kOS Skill and Recipe Framework Specification

## Overview

The kOS Skill and Recipe Framework defines how all AI behaviors, tasks, and workflows are modularly structured, composed, executed, and evolved over time. This layer is the **heart of kOS automation and intelligence orchestration**. It allows any user or agent to create, modify, and share AI behaviors using plain language, pseudocode, YAML, or JSON formats.

## Core Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| Skill | A modular, testable, and reusable unit of AI logic (e.g., Summarize Text, Translate Language, Classify Image). |
| Recipe | A declarative workflow that defines how multiple skills, tools, and data sources are chained together to accomplish complex tasks. |
| Recipe Registry | A centralized (or decentralized in future phases) index of all known recipes available to the system. |
| Adapter Mapping | Recipes reference skills, and skills reference adapters (APIs, local tools, etc.) that perform the actual execution. |
| Execution Context | Each recipe execution retains runtime context (inputs, outputs, logs, decision paths). |
| Meta-Learning Feedback | After execution, performance metrics and user feedback get logged for recipe improvement and self-learning. |

---

## Skill Structure

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| Skill Name | Unique identifier for the skill |
| Input Schema | Expected input types and formats |
| Execution Method | Which adapter, API, or tool performs this skill |
| Output Schema | Expected output types |
| Metadata | Performance logs, source history, last update date |

**Example Skill (YAML):**

```yaml
skill_name: summarize_text
input:
  - type: text
execution:
  adapter: openai_adapter
  function: gpt_4_summarize
output:
  - type: summary_text
```

---

## Recipe Structure

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Recipe Name | Unique identifier |
| Trigger | Natural language patterns or API call triggers that invoke this recipe |
| Steps | Sequential list of skills to execute |
| Conditions | Optional logic conditions per step |
| Parallelization | Allow parallel execution for non-dependent steps |
| Error Handling | Recovery steps if errors occur |
| Meta-Tags | Tags for discoverability and search |

**Example Recipe (YAML):**

```yaml
recipe_name: summarize_pdf_and_notify_slack
trigger: "summarize pdf and slack it"
steps:
  - skill: extract_text_from_pdf
    input: {file_path}
  - skill: summarize_text
    input: {extracted_text}
  - skill: format_slack_message
    input: {summary}
  - skill: send_slack_message
    input: {formatted_message}
```

---

## Recipe Types

| Type | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Single-Step Recipe | One skill execution per user request (e.g., translate text) |
| Multi-Step Sequential | Linear workflows (e.g., fetch → analyze → report) |
| Conditional Branching | Recipes that adjust execution based on data or user input |
| Parallelized Recipes | Run multiple skills simultaneously for speed or comparison |
| Meta-Recipes | Recipes that generate new recipes or compose other recipes dynamically |

---

## Recipe Lifecycle

1. **Creation:** Human writes, AI suggests, or system learns a new recipe.
2. **Registration:** Recipe is stored in the Recipe Registry with versioning.
3. **Execution:** Triggered by user or agent intent.
4. **Logging:** Execution context, errors, metrics, and outputs logged.
5. **Learning:** System tracks effectiveness and suggests optimizations.
6. **Evolution:** Recipes updated over time based on usage patterns and user edits.

---

## Recipe Storage Formats

| Format | Use Case |
|---|---|
| YAML | Human-readable editing and sharing |
| JSON | Programmatic storage and transmission |
| NLP Templates | For ultra-simple recipe definitions using natural language |
| Code-Embedded Recipes | For developer-focused recipes in Python or TypeScript |

---

## Integration with Adapter and Orchestration Layers

- **Skills map to adapters.**
- **Recipes map to skill chains.**
- **The Orchestration Engine resolves and executes recipes.**
- **The Meta-Learning Layer tracks recipe usage and optimization paths.**

## Sample Recipe Types (Starter Library Examples)

| Recipe Name | Function |
|---|---|
| summarize_pdf_and_notify_slack | Summarize PDF and send to Slack |
| multi_model_factual_answer | Query multiple LLMs and distill consensus answer |
| keyword_extraction | Extract keywords from user text |
| seo_tag_generator | Generate SEO tags from content |
| multi_agent_code_review | Let multiple LLMs audit a code snippet and compare findings |
| ethical_content_review | Run content through Junzi ethical filter |
| entity_extraction | Extract named entities from text input |
| pdf_to_vector_db | Ingest PDF into Vector DB for future retrieval |
| document_translation_pipeline | Translate documents and deliver via email |
| user_behavior_analysis | Analyze user chat history for behavior patterns |

---

## Next Steps for Agents

- Draft and publish the Recipe Registry Schema
- Populate Starter Recipe Library
- Build Recipe Loader Module in the Orchestration Engine
- Implement Recipe Editing UI/CLI
- Connect Recipes to the Adapter Layer
- Integrate Meta-Learning tracking for recipe optimization
