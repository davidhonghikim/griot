# JUNZI Phase 5 - Detailed Technical Specification: Automated Rule Evolution Engine (AREE)

## Module Name:

Automated Rule Evolution Engine (AREE)

## Module Purpose:

AREE leverages ethical performance data, stakeholder feedback trends, and pattern recognition results to autonomously draft, simulate, and propose new ethical rule updates for stakeholder voting. It closes the loop between ethical risk detection and rule evolution, supporting continuous improvement of the JUNZI ethical decision system.

---

## System Architecture

### Rule Evolution Pipeline:

1. **Input Data Aggregator:**

   - Ingests data from:
     - EPR (ethical patterns)
     - EKB (knowledge base references)
     - ERFE (risk forecasts)
     - PASv2 (simulation outcomes)
     - SIRE (stakeholder impact shifts)

2. **Rule Drafting Engine:**

   - Uses NLP and ML models (e.g., GPT-style fine-tuned LLMs) to generate human-readable rule proposals.
   - Formats proposals in DERE-compatible JSON rule schema.

3. **Ethical Impact Simulation Module:**

   - Runs each drafted rule through PASv2 to forecast decision flow and risk impact.
   - Scores each rule draft on:
     - Expected stakeholder benefit
     - Risk reduction
     - Ethical conflict avoidance

4. **Draft Review and Adjustment Layer:**

   - Allows AI-in-the-loop and human-in-the-loop review and editing.
   - Supports governance-locked editing sessions.

5. **Voting Proposal Trigger:**

   - Submits finalized rule drafts to SVN for stakeholder voting.

6. **Post-Vote Deployment Automation:**

   - On approval, auto-updates DERE with the new rule.
   - Triggers JEDE recalibration if needed.

7. **Change Logging Layer:**

   - Full rule evolution history logged into IRRL and EAT.

---

## Data Models

### Rule Evolution Proposal:

```json
{
  "proposal_id": "uuid",
  "proposed_rule": "JSON schema",
  "impact_assessment_summary": "string",
  "simulation_results": "JSON",
  "risk_reduction_score": "float",
  "stakeholder_benefit_index": "float",
  "submitter": "AREE | HumanOperator",
  "status": "Draft | UnderReview | SubmittedToSVN | Approved | Rejected",
  "created_at": "ISO8601"
}
```

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint                                   | Method | Description                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| /aree/generate-draft                       | POST   | Creates an AI-generated rule proposal draft                 |
| /aree/get-proposal/{proposal\_id}          | GET    | Retrieves full proposal details                             |
| /aree/submit-to-svn/{proposal\_id}         | POST   | Sends finalized proposal for voting                         |
| /aree/get-impact-simulation/{proposal\_id} | GET    | Returns simulation results for a proposal                   |
| /aree/get-rule-evolution-history           | POST   | Retrieves history of all proposed and approved rule changes |

---

## Algorithms and Logic

1. **NLP Rule Drafting Model:**

   - Transformer-based language model fine-tuned on ethical reasoning datasets.

2. **Impact Scoring Algorithms:**

   - Calculates projected stakeholder benefit and risk mitigation scores.

3. **Simulation Feedback Loop:**

   - Filters out drafts that fail minimum impact thresholds during PASv2 tests.

---

## Performance Targets

- **Draft Generation Time:** Under 5 minutes per proposal
- **Simulation Feedback Time:** Under 15 minutes per rule draft
- **Vote Submission Latency:** Under 1 minute after approval

---

## Monitoring and Metrics

- **Draft Acceptance Rate**
- **Average Stakeholder Benefit Score (per submitted rule)**
- **Risk Reduction Trendline Post-Rule Changes**
- **Simulation-to-Vote Success Ratio**

Monitoring Tools: Prometheus + Grafana; Rule evolution dashboards.

---

## Security Considerations

- RBAC for draft review and submission stages
- MFA for human editing phases
- All proposal generation and edits logged in EAT
- Model access restricted to ethics-approved environments

---

## Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests:**

  - NLP rule draft generation logic
  - Scoring function calculations

- **Integration Tests:**

  - AREE â†” PASv2, SVN, DERE, EAT, IRRL workflows

- **Load Tests:**

  - Multiple concurrent rule drafts and simulations

- **Quality Assurance Tests:**

  - Governance review feedback incorporation tests

---

## Deployment Profile

- **Language:** Python 3.11 (LLM interfacing, orchestration)
- **ML Frameworks:** Hugging Face Transformers, Scikit-learn
- **Containerization:** Docker + Kubernetes
- **Storage:** PostgreSQL for proposal metadata; S3 for draft artifacts

---

## Dependencies

- PASv2 API
- SVN API
- DERE API
- IRRL API
- EAT API
- EPR API
- EKB API
- SIRE API
- ERFE API
