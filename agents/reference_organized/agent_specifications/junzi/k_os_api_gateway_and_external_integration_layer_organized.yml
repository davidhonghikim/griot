# kOS API Gateway and External Integration Layer

## Overview
The **kOS API Gateway and External Integration Layer (AGEIL)** serves as the secure, scalable, and ethics-filtered interface between the kOS ecosystem and any external systems, users, applications, or third-party services. It handles all inbound and outbound API traffic while enforcing authentication, rate limiting, ethics checks, and protocol translation.

## Core Functions

| Function                  | Purpose                                          |
|------------------------ |---------------------------------------------- |
| External API Exposure     | Safely expose internal kOS agent and module functions to external clients |
| Protocol Translation      | Convert between internal communication formats and external API standards |
| Authentication and Rate Limiting | Protect system resources from abuse and overload |
| Ethics Gateway Filtering  | Block any external requests that violate JUNZI ethical policies |
| Monitoring and Metrics    | Track API usage, performance, and security breaches |
| Multi-Tenant Support      | Allow separate user or organizational API namespaces |

---

## Supported API Types

| API Type                 | Description                            |
|---------------------- |------------------------------------ |
| REST API               | JSON-based synchronous endpoints     |
| gRPC API               | High-performance binary messaging    |
| WebSocket Streams      | Real-time event feeds                |
| GraphQL (Optional)     | For flexible data queries            |
| Webhooks               | External event callbacks             |

---

## API Gateway Architecture

| Layer                    | Function                                      |
|---------------------- |------------------------------------------- |
| Authentication Layer    | OAuth2, API Key, or Mutual TLS validation  |
| Rate Limiter            | Throttle excessive request volumes         |
| Ethics Filter Layer (JUNZI) | Analyze incoming requests for ethical policy compliance |
| Protocol Translator      | Map internal kOS communication bus messages to API responses |
| Metrics Collector        | Capture API usage and performance stats   |
| Logging and Audit Trail  | Record all external API access attempts   |

---

## Developer Access Control

| Control Type            | Description                                 |
|--------------------- |---------------------------------------- |
| API Key Management      | Issue, revoke, and rotate API keys         |
| Role-Based Endpoint Access | Restrict certain endpoints to specific user or agent roles |
| Per-Node-Class Rate Policies | Limit external API usage by target Node Class (e.g., Sentinel endpoints throttled more aggressively) |

---

## Ethical API Filtering Rules

| Rule Type               | Example Behavior                           |
|--------------------- |-------------------------------------- |
| Action Type Filtering   | Block external attempts to trigger unethical agent actions |
| Data Access Controls    | Prevent API access to sensitive user or system data without consent |
| Contextual Overrides    | Allow or deny requests based on system state, load, or ethics history |

---

## API Monitoring Metrics

| Metric Type              | Purpose                                    |
|---------------------- |---------------------------------------- |
| API Request Count        | Total requests over time                 |
| Error Rate               | % of failed API calls                    |
| Rate Limit Violations    | Count of exceeded quota attempts         |
| Ethics Filtered Requests | Number of blocked or modified requests   |
| Average Latency          | API responsiveness                      |

---

## Security Safeguards

| Security Feature        | Description                                  |
|--------------------- |---------------------------------------- |
| TLS Encryption          | Enforce HTTPS and secure channels         |
| API Key Rotation Policies | Enforce key lifespans and periodic rotation |
| IP Whitelisting/Blacklisting | Optional external client filtering         |
| JSON Web Token (JWT) Support | Optional stateless authentication         |
| Content Validation      | Prevent injection attacks and malformed payloads |

---

## Developer API Documentation Standards

- OpenAPI (Swagger) definitions for all public-facing endpoints
- Markdown `.md` endpoint documentation for all internal kOS services
- Ethics impact notes included per endpoint

---

## Extensibility

- Support for future GraphQL, gRPC streaming, and AI-driven API traffic shaping
- Plugin system for adding custom API endpoints mapped to new agents or Node Classes

---

The **kOS API Gateway and External Integration Layer (AGEIL)** acts as the ethical, secure, and scalable bridge between kOS and the external world, ensuring all external interactions pass through strict policy, security, and ethical compliance checkpoints before entering the ecosystem.
