# ✅ Overview
This document defines the **phased buildout plan** for implementing the **kOS Scalable Deployment and Process Framework**, targeting deployment modes from **solo dev** up to **enterprise and global mesh federation**.

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Foundation - Solo Developer Deployment

| Component | Deliverables |
|---|---|
| Source Control | Git repo setup, monorepo or polyrepo structure |
| Local Development | Docker Compose for local agents, MongoDB, Weaviate (ChromaDB optional for early testing) |
| Vector Store | Deploy Weaviate or ChromaDB with VectorStore API wrapper |
| Graph Database | Local Neo4j single node |
| CI/CD | Local Git pre-commit hooks, basic pytest/unit test execution |
| Agent Memory | IndexedDB for browser agents, MongoDB for backend storage |
| Ethics Checkpoints | Static prompt templates with manual review steps |

---

## ✅ Phase 2: Team Scale - CI/CD and Testing

| Component | Deliverables |
|---|---|
| CI/CD Pipelines | GitHub Actions / GitLab CI configs with build, test, deploy stages |
| Multi-Env Config | Dev / Test / Staging config environments |
| Vector Store Hardening | Full Weaviate deployment with Prometheus monitoring |
| Drift Detection | Integrate Mzee-based drift scoring per agent session |
| Agent Performance Logging | Extend Hakim metrics collection |
| Ethical Gate Checks | Junzi modules integrated in CI to validate agent output ethics compliance |
| Test Coverage Metrics | Pytest coverage reports per commit |

---

## ✅ Phase 3: Enterprise - Multi-Node and Observability

| Component | Deliverables |
|---|---|
| Kubernetes Deployment | Single-node then multi-node K8s configs |
| Service Mesh | Istio/Linkerd deployment for internal service discovery |
| Centralized Metrics | Prometheus + Grafana dashboards across agents |
| Log Aggregation | ELK stack or Loki for multi-node logs |
| API Gateway | NGINX / Traefik for external access control |
| Governance Approval Gates | Sachem agent orchestration decision layer |
| Full Neo4j Cluster | Replicated graph for high availability |

---

## ✅ Phase 4: Federation and Global Mesh

| Component | Deliverables |
|---|---|
| Peer Discovery API | Dynamic node discovery across data centers or organizations |
| Federated Vector Layers | Cross-node semantic queries via KLF Event Bus |
| Encrypted Multi-Node Messaging | Zero-trust, signed agent-to-agent communication |
| Knowledge Diffusion Tracking | Trace AKU and Recipe propagation across node clusters |
| Agent Mesh Coordinator | Archon / Sachem multi-node task routing logic |
| Federated Governance | Distributed ethical policy enforcement (Junzi nodes per cluster) |

---

## ✅ Cross-Phase Considerations
- ✅ Modular Node Class separation throughout
- ✅ KLF message protocol integration from the start
- ✅ Multi-tenant isolation for each deployment tier
- ✅ Compatibility with AI-Q and existing AKU/Skill/Recipe libraries
