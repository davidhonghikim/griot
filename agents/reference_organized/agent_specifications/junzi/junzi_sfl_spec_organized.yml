# JUNZI Phase 2 - Detailed Technical Specification: Stakeholder Feedback Loop (SFL)

## Module Name:

Stakeholder Feedback Loop (SFL)

## Module Purpose:

The SFL captures, processes, categorizes, prioritizes, and integrates stakeholder feedback to drive continuous ethical rule improvement and system adaptation within JUNZI. It ensures that stakeholder voices remain active inputs into ethical governance at every operational stage.

---

## System Architecture

### Feedback Lifecycle Pipeline:

1. **Feedback Ingestion Layer:**

   - Multi-channel support:
     - Web Portal UI
     - API endpoints
     - Email parser (IMAP listener)
     - Social media sentiment scraping (optional)

2. **Preprocessing Layer:**

   - Input validation and spam filtering
   - Sentiment analysis using NLP classifiers (BERT or DistilBERT fine-tuned for stakeholder sentiment)

3. **Categorization Engine:**

   - Feedback classification by type:
     - Complaint
     - Suggestion
     - Ethical Concern
     - Consent Objection
     - General Comment

4. **Stakeholder Weighting Layer:**

   - Applies influence weighting based on stakeholder profile metadata (as defined during Phase 1 Stakeholder Mapping).
   - Dynamic recalibration based on historical engagement and impact.

5. **Priority Scoring Module:**

   - Multi-factor priority calculation:
     - Sentiment Severity
     - Stakeholder Weight
     - Ethical Risk Score (from RAME)
     - Historical Topic Urgency

6. **Impact Mapper:**

   - Links feedback items to affected rule sets, decision categories, or system modules.
   - Suggests candidate rules for review or modification.

7. **Feedback-to-Rule Proposal Engine:**

   - Generates preliminary rule update proposals for DERE when feedback volume or severity triggers thresholds.

8. **Audit Hook Layer:**

   - Sends all feedback entries, processing outcomes, and proposal actions to EAT.

## Data Models

### Feedback Submission Payload:

```json
{
  "feedback_id": "uuid",
  "user_id": "uuid",
  "feedback_type": "Complaint | Suggestion | Objection | Concern | Comment",
  "description": "string",
  "urgency": "Low | Medium | High | Critical",
  "submitted_via": "Web | API | Email | External",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601"
}
```

### Processed Feedback Record:

```json
{
  "feedback_id": "uuid",
  "categorization": "string",
  "sentiment_score": "float",
  "stakeholder_weight": "float",
  "priority_score": "float",
  "linked_rules": ["rule_id"],
  "action_recommendation": "string",
  "status": "Pending | In Review | Resolved | Escalated",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601"
}
```

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint                            | Method | Description                                      |
| ----------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| /sfl/submit-feedback                | POST   | Accepts new stakeholder feedback                 |
| /sfl/get-feedback/{feedback\_id}    | GET    | Retrieves feedback details                       |
| /sfl/feedback-status/{feedback\_id} | GET    | Returns processing status                        |
| /sfl/export-feedback                | POST   | Exports filtered feedback logs                   |
| /sfl/generate-rule-proposal         | POST   | Triggers rule proposal based on feedback cluster |

---

## Algorithms and Logic

1. **Sentiment Analysis Model:**

   - Transformer-based sentiment classifier (BERT with ethical domain fine-tuning)

2. **Stakeholder Weighting Formula:**

```python
priority_score = (sentiment_severity * 0.4) + (stakeholder_weight * 0.3) + (ethical_risk_score * 0.3)
```

3. **Feedback-to-Rule Thresholds:**
   - Rule proposal generation triggers if:
     - More than 5 high-priority feedback items cluster on the same rule within 7 days, or
     - Cumulative Stakeholder Weighted Priority Score exceeds pre-set threshold

---

## Performance Targets

- **Feedback Processing Latency:** Under 500ms for single item categorization and scoring
- **Daily Feedback Throughput:** 50,000+ submissions supported
- **Feedback-to-Rule Proposal Latency:** Under 1 minute for triggering proposal generation after cluster threshold met

---

## Monitoring and Metrics

- **Feedback Volume by Type**
- **Stakeholder Engagement Rate**
- **Rule Proposal Conversion Rate**
- **Feedback Resolution Time**

Monitoring stack: ELK (ElasticSearch, Logstash, Kibana) + Prometheus for processing metrics.

---

## Security Considerations

- CAPTCHA and anti-spam measures for public submission endpoints
- OAuth 2.0 user authentication for sensitive feedback actions
- GDPR-compliant consent logging for feedback usage
- Data encryption at rest and in transit

---

## Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests:**

  - NLP sentiment classification
  - Categorization logic
  - Priority scoring formulae

- **Integration Tests:**

  - SFL → DERE feedback-driven rule pipeline
  - SFL → EAT audit logging

- **Load Tests:**

  - Ingestion under peak load

- **Ethical Simulation Tests:**

  - Rule proposal generation accuracy against historical ethical scenarios

---

## Deployment Profile

- **Language:** Python 3.11 or Node.js 18+
- **ML Libraries:** Hugging Face Transformers, Scikit-learn
- **Containerization:** Docker + Kubernetes
- **Storage:** MongoDB or PostgreSQL

---

## Dependencies

- DERE API (for rule proposals)
- EAT API (for audit logging)
- JEDE API (for rule linkage verification)
