# JUNZI Ethical Governance and Oversight Charter

**Node Class:** JunziNode  
**System:** kOS Ecosystem  
**Document Type:** Ethical Governance Framework

---

## Mission of JUNZI Ethical Oversight:
To ensure that all actions, outputs, models, and processes within JUNZI adhere to the HIEROS Code, uphold public trust, minimize bias, and operate transparently, fairly, and accountably at all times.

---

## Governance Structure:

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| **Ethical Governance Board (EGB)** | Multidisciplinary team overseeing JUNZIâ€™s ethical decision-making, composed of AI ethicists, legal experts, cultural representatives, and citizen advocates. |
| **Data Integrity Auditor** | Independent entity responsible for verifying source attribution, data lineage, and system non-tampering. |
| **Bias Monitoring Council** | Special task force responsible for detecting, reporting, and mitigating AI or systemic bias within JUNZI processes. |
| **Community Feedback Council** | Represents citizen concerns, handles appeals and disputes from the public or flagged entities. |

---

## Ethical Decision-Making Workflow:

| Step | Action |
|---|---|
| 1 | Ethical flag raised (e.g., high false positive rate, bias detection, public complaint) |
| 2 | Preliminary review by internal JUNZI moderation agents |
| 3 | Case escalated to EGB if issue affects public output, model training, or system trustworthiness |
| 4 | Formal ruling logged with full transparency |
| 5 | Public report issued for major decisions |

---

## Dispute Resolution Pathway (For Flagged Entities):

| Stage | Description |
|---|---|
| **Stage 1** | Entity files formal dispute via `/junzi/api/v1/disputes/` |
| **Stage 2** | JUNZI HITL moderation team performs initial review |
| **Stage 3** | If unresolved, escalates to Community Feedback Council for hearing |
| **Stage 4** | Final appeal option: Independent Ethics Arbiter (external to kOS) |
| **Stage 5** | Outcome published with reasoning, and affected entity notified |

---

## Core Ethical Principles (Aligned with HIEROS):

| Principle | Implementation in JUNZI |
|---|---|
| **Nonpartisanship** | Multi-model bias audits, external oversight, and balanced datasets |
| **Transparency** | Every public-facing output must include source references and explainable reasoning |
| **Accountability** | All JUNZI agents and outputs are subject to human override and audit logs |
| **Right to Challenge** | All flagged entities can dispute or appeal system outputs |
| **Cultural Sensitivity** | All naming, reporting, and classification processes undergo cultural bias review |
| **Zero-Bias Intelligence** | Continuous testing and cross-model validation pipelines for fairness enforcement |

---

## Reporting Obligations:
- **Quarterly Bias and Accuracy Report**
- **Annual Transparency Report**
- **Public Archive of All Ethical Rulings and Model Changes**

---

## Governance Authority Scope:
- Review and approve any major model retrainings
- Authorize deployment of new risk-scoring methodologies
- Approve major public policy decisions (e.g., new data source integrations)
- Rule on all public disputes and appeals

---

**This document now serves as the canonical Ethical Governance and Oversight Charter for JUNZI within the kOS ecosystem until formally revised.**
