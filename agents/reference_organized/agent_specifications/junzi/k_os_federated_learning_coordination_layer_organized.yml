# kOS Federated Learning Coordination Layer

## Overview
The **kOS Federated Learning Coordination Layer (FLCL)** enables decentralized, privacy-preserving, cross-node machine learning by orchestrating model training, gradient aggregation, and ethics-compliant data handling across geographically and administratively distributed nodes within the kOS ecosystem.

---

## Core Functions

| Function                  | Purpose                                  |
|-------------------- |-------------------------------------- |
| Model Distribution       | Send global model snapshots to participating nodes for local training |
| Gradient Aggregation      | Collect and merge local model updates without raw data transfer |
| Ethics-Governed Data Usage | Ensure all training respects consent, privacy, and ethics policies |
| Node Participation Management | Handle dynamic join/leave of nodes during training cycles |
| Fault Tolerant Aggregation | Mitigate impact of dropped or failed nodes |
| Federated Learning Incentivization | Integrate with Tokidao for rewarding contributing nodes |

---

## Federated Learning Workflow

1. **Global Model Initialization:** Define initial model and training parameters
2. **Node Enrollment:** Eligible nodes register for current training round
3. **Ethics Compliance Pre-Check:** Validate local data usage aligns with JUNZI and user consent
4. **Local Training Phase:** Each node trains model on local data
5. **Secure Update Transmission:** Nodes send model weight updates, not raw data
6. **Aggregation Phase:** Coordinator aggregates updates using techniques like Federated Averaging
7. **Model Update Broadcast:** Distribute improved global model to all nodes
8. **Repeat or Finalize:** Iterate for multiple rounds or finalize model for production deployment

## Supported Aggregation Methods

| Method                  | Description                            |
|------------------- |---------------------------------- |
| Federated Averaging    | Standard weighted averaging        |
| Differential Privacy Masking | Add noise for user data privacy    |
| Gradient Clipping      | Limit influence of outlier nodes   |
| Byzantine-Resilient Aggregation | Filter out malicious or faulty node updates |
| Ethics-Weighted Aggregation | Adjust weights based on node ethics compliance history |

---

## Security and Privacy Safeguards

| Safeguard               | Description                                 |
|------------------- |------------------------------------ |
| Secure Communication    | All updates transmitted over encrypted channels |
| Ethics Approval Gate    | Pre-training ethics validation per node |
| Anonymized Contributions | No identifiable node metadata in aggregated updates |
| Update Signature Verification | Cryptographically sign all node updates |
| Malicious Node Detection | Flag nodes with repeated anomalous updates |

---

## Node Eligibility Criteria

| Requirement                | Purpose                                  |
|--------------------- |-------------------------------------- |
| Sufficient Local Resources | Ensure node can complete training rounds |
| Ethical Compliance Record | Disqualify nodes with ethics violation history |
| Consent-Compliant Data   | Validate user consent for all local training data |
| Minimum Uptime Guarantee | Reduce dropouts mid-training          |

---

## API Endpoints (Coordinator Side)

| Method | Endpoint                     | Purpose                        |
|------ |------------------------- |----------------------------- |
| GET   | `/fl/model/current`        | Fetch current global model snapshot |
| POST  | `/fl/node/register`        | Node enrollment for next training round |
| POST  | `/fl/node/upload`          | Submit local model update      |
| GET   | `/fl/aggregation/status`   | View current aggregation progress |
| POST  | `/fl/policy/ethics-check` | Run ethics pre-screen on node data profile |

---

## Monitoring and Metrics

| Metric Type             | Description                                  |
|------------------ |-------------------------------------- |
| Node Participation Rate | % of eligible nodes joining training rounds |
| Update Acceptance Rate | % of submitted updates passing validation |
| Ethics Compliance Score | Measure of ethics rule adherence during training |
| Aggregation Latency     | Time taken per aggregation cycle         |
| Model Convergence Rate | Improvement per training round           |

---

## Extensibility

- AI-driven dynamic node eligibility scoring
- Integration with external federated learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow Federated)
- Ethics-weighted loss function modules
- Federated transfer learning and cross-Node-Class model sharing
