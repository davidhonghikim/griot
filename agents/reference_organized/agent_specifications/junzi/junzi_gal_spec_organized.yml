# JUNZI Phase 7 - Detailed Technical Specification: Geopolitical Adaptation Layer (GAL)

## Module Name:

Geopolitical Adaptation Layer (GAL)

## Module Purpose:

GAL ensures that JUNZI remains compliant with regional legal frameworks, cultural norms, and geopolitical sensitivities. It dynamically adapts ethical decision processes, rule applications, and stakeholder engagement strategies based on real-time geopolitical intelligence and regulatory updates.

---

## System Architecture

### Geopolitical Adaptation Pipeline:

1. **Geopolitical Intelligence Feed Handler:**

   - Ingests regulatory updates and geopolitical event data from:
     - External legal data providers
     - Regional governance bodies
     - Real-time news sentiment analysis APIs
     - International human rights monitoring feeds

2. **Regulatory Change Detection Engine:**

   - Applies NLP-based policy change detection to identify new legal requirements affecting ethical decisions.

3. **Cultural Contextualization Module:**

   - Maps decisions and stakeholder interactions against regional cultural models.
   - Provides cultural sensitivity flags to JEDE and SFL.

4. **Adaptive Policy Overlay Manager:**

   - Creates temporary or permanent overlays on DERE rule execution logic for specific regions.
   - Supports:
     - Rule exemptions
     - Modified decision weighting
     - Stakeholder engagement script alterations

5. **Regional Risk Sensitivity Scorer:**

   - Quantifies geopolitical risk levels by region.
   - Adjusts ERFE risk models and AREE rule recommendations accordingly.

6. **Governance Notification Layer:**

   - Sends alerts to governance teams when high-impact geopolitical changes occur.

7. **Audit and Compliance Tracker:**

   - Logs all adaptations for regulatory audit trails (stored in EAT).

## Data Models

### Geopolitical Adaptation Event:

```json
{
  "event_id": "uuid",
  "region": "string",
  "event_type": "RegulatoryChange | CulturalSensitivity | PoliticalUnrest | LegalSanction",
  "description": "string",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601",
  "impacted_modules": ["JEDE", "DERE", "SFL", "ERFE", "AREE"],
  "adaptation_applied": "string"
}
```

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint                                 | Method | Description                                         |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| /gal/get-current-regional-adaptations    | GET    | Lists active geopolitical adaptations per region    |
| /gal/submit-intelligence-feed            | POST   | Ingests new geopolitical event data                 |
| /gal/get-event-history/{region}          | POST   | Retrieves past adaptation events for audit          |
| /gal/get-risk-sensitivity-score/{region} | GET    | Returns current geopolitical risk sensitivity level |
| /gal/apply-adaptive-overlay              | POST   | Manually triggers a regional policy overlay         |

---

## Algorithms and Logic

1. **Regulatory NLP Parser:**

   - Identifies region-specific legal triggers from incoming texts.

2. **Cultural Sensitivity Mapper:**

   - Flags stakeholder engagement processes against regional sensitivity profiles.

3. **Adaptive Overlay Application Engine:**

   - Dynamically injects policy modifications into DERE and JEDE flow paths.

---

## Performance Targets

- **Intelligence Feed Ingestion Latency:** Under 5 minutes per source
- **Policy Overlay Deployment Time:** Under 10 minutes
- **Regulatory Compliance Detection Accuracy:** >95%

---

## Monitoring and Metrics

- **Adaptation Event Frequency by Region**
- **Policy Overlay Uptime**
- **Geopolitical Risk Sensitivity Trend**
- **Regulatory Response Lag Time**

Monitoring Tools: Prometheus + Grafana; Regional adaptation dashboards.

---

## Security Considerations

- Data source authenticity validation
- RBAC for manual overlay triggers
- Full audit logging (stored in EAT)
- TLS encryption for external feed integrations

---

## Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests:**

  - NLP policy detection accuracy
  - Overlay injection logic

- **Integration Tests:**

  - GAL â†” JEDE, DERE, SFL, ERFE, AREE, EAT workflows

- **Load Tests:**

  - High-frequency geopolitical event simulation

- **Compliance Validation Tests:**

  - Regional legal adherence checks post-adaptation

---

## Deployment Profile

- **Language:** Python 3.11
- **Containerization:** Docker + Kubernetes
- **Storage:** PostgreSQL for adaptation logs; S3 for external feed archives

---

## Dependencies

- JEDE API
- DERE API
- SFL API
- ERFE API
- AREE API
- EAT API
