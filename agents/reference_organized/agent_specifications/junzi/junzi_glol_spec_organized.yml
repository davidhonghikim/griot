# JUNZI Phase 4 - Detailed Technical Specification: Global Load Optimization Layer (GLOL)

## Module Name:

Global Load Optimization Layer (GLOL)

## Module Purpose:

The GLOL ensures that JUNZI maintains low-latency, high-availability performance across all global regions by dynamically routing, balancing, and caching API and decision traffic. It orchestrates resource allocation, geo-distributed load balancing, and edge optimization for ethical decision processing at scale.

---

## System Architecture

### Load Optimization Pipeline:

1. **Global Traffic Manager:**

   - Routes incoming API and decision traffic to the closest or least-loaded regional JUNZI cluster.
   - Uses latency-based routing, geolocation policies, and failover triggers.

2. **Regional Load Balancers:**

   - Distributes intra-region traffic across JEDE, DERE, SFL, and other module pods.
   - Supports Layer 7 application-aware load balancing.

3. **Edge Caching Layer:**

   - Caches non-dynamic API responses and low-frequency rule queries at regional edge locations.
   - Reduces global latency for high-demand endpoints (e.g., /cti/decision-explanation)

4. **Auto-Scaler Controller:**

   - Dynamically scales pod replicas based on:
     - Decision request rate
     - Stakeholder feedback load
     - Risk event frequency

5. **Failover and Disaster Recovery Router:**

   - Redirects traffic away from unhealthy or offline regions.
   - Triggers cross-region data sync for hot failover sites.

6. **Traffic Health Monitor:**

   - Continuously monitors:
     - API error rates
     - Latency spikes
     - Node availability
   - Feeds metrics to the AMRE and EDDG for further action if needed.

## Data Models

### Load Balancing Routing Rule:

```json
{
  "rule_id": "uuid",
  "routing_criteria": "Latency | Geolocation | LoadThreshold | Failover",
  "target_region": "string",
  "priority": "integer",
  "status": "Active | Inactive",
  "created_at": "ISO8601"
}
```

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint                           | Method | Description                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| /glol/get-routing-status           | GET    | Returns current global routing configuration    |
| /glol/update-routing-rule          | POST   | Adds or modifies routing rules                  |
| /glol/get-region-load/{region\_id} | GET    | Returns real-time load stats for a region       |
| /glol/trigger-failover             | POST   | Manually triggers region failover               |
| /glol/traffic-health-summary       | GET    | Returns overall system load and latency metrics |

---

## Algorithms and Logic

1. **Latency-Aware Routing Algorithm:**

   - Continuously measures round-trip time (RTT) to user regions.
   - Routes traffic to the region with the lowest RTT within SLA bounds.

2. **Load Threshold Balancing:**

   - Calculates active request queue depth per node.
   - Redistributes load when regional thresholds exceed limits.

3. **Health-Based Failover Decisioning:**

   - Monitors health check endpoints for all regions.
   - Auto-triggers failover on multi-metric threshold breach (latency, errors, unavailability).

---

## Performance Targets

- **Global Routing Decision Latency:** Under 50ms
- **Intra-Region Load Balancing Latency:** Under 10ms
- **Failover Trigger Time:** Under 1 minute post-health breach
- **Cache Hit Rate for Edge Requests:** >85% for eligible endpoints

---

## Monitoring and Metrics

- **Regional Load Distribution**
- **Global API Response Time Distribution**
- **Failover Event Frequency**
- **Cache Hit vs Miss Ratio**

Monitoring Tools: Prometheus + Grafana; global load heatmaps and latency dashboards.

---

## Security Considerations

- OAuth 2.0 API access control for routing rule updates
- Rate limiting for high-risk public endpoints
- TLS encryption for all inter-region and client communication
- Health check API endpoints secured against misuse

---

## Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests:**

  - Routing rule logic
  - Load threshold calculation

- **Integration Tests:**

  - GLOL â†” JEDE, DERE, CTI traffic flow tests
  - Failover trigger and response validation

- **Load Tests:**

  - High-volume traffic simulation across regions

- **Failover Simulation Tests:**

  - Multi-region outage scenarios

---

## Deployment Profile

- **Language:** GoLang (recommended for high concurrency) or Node.js 18+
- **Containerization:** Docker + Kubernetes
- **Infrastructure:** Global CDN and multi-region K8s clusters

---

## Dependencies

- JEDE API
- DERE API
- CTI API
- AMRE API (for failover triggers)
- EAT API (for audit logging)
