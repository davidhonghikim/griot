# kOS Data Marketplace Integration Module

## Overview
The **kOS Data Marketplace Integration Module (DMIM)** enables secure, consent-driven, ethics-compliant participation of kOS nodes and users in decentralized or federated data marketplaces. This module facilitates controlled data sharing, ethical filtering, pricing mechanisms, and consent auditability for all data transactions across the kOS ecosystem.

## Core Functions

| Function                  | Purpose                                  |
|-------------------- |-------------------------------------- |
| Data Asset Registration  | Allow nodes and users to register data assets for sale or sharing |
| Consent-Governed Access  | Enforce user consent and ethical approval before any data transaction |
| Ethics Filter Enforcement | JUNZI pre-sale ethical screening for all data transactions |
| Marketplace API Adapter  | Support interoperability with external decentralized data marketplaces |
| Tokenized Incentive Integration | Facilitate micro-payments, rewards, or reputation gains for data contributions (via Tokidao layer) |
| Transaction Auditing      | Maintain tamper-evident logs of all data transactions |

---

## Supported Data Asset Types

| Data Type              | Example Use Cases                          |
|------------------ |----------------------------------- |
| Sensor Data         | IoT, environmental monitoring nodes |
| User-Created Content | Text, media, annotations           |
| Behavioral Metrics  | Agent interaction patterns          |
| Training Datasets   | AI model training sets              |
| Aggregated Node Statistics | System-wide anonymized metrics   |

---

## Transaction Workflow

1. **Data Asset Creation:** Node or user packages data with metadata and ethical tags
2. **Consent Verification:** Confirm user and system-level consent flags
3. **Ethics Risk Assessment:** JUNZI pre-sale filter run on data profile
4. **Marketplace Listing:** Asset published with price, terms, and usage restrictions
5. **Buyer Discovery:** External or internal agents browse and select data assets
6. **Transaction Approval:** Smart contract or manual approval based on terms
7. **Secure Data Transfer:** Only approved buyers receive access
8. **Audit Logging:** Full transaction recorded with consent and ethics metadata

## Consent and Privacy Safeguards

| Safeguard               | Description                                 |
|------------------- |------------------------------------ |
| Opt-In Only Participation | Default user state is non-participating unless explicitly opted-in |
| Granular Consent Flags | User can allow specific data types or asset categories only |
| Usage Restrictions Metadata | Define allowable usage scope for each data asset |
| Revocation Rights | Users can revoke consent retroactively for future sales |
| Differential Privacy Option | Optional privacy-preserving data transformations |

---

## Marketplace API Integration

| API Method           | Description                                  |
|---------------- |------------------------------------ |
| GET   | `/data-marketplace/assets` | List available data assets |
| POST  | `/data-marketplace/asset` | Register new data asset |
| POST  | `/data-marketplace/consent-check` | Verify user consent for asset sale |
| POST  | `/data-marketplace/transaction` | Execute data sale or sharing event |
| GET   | `/data-marketplace/transactions` | Retrieve transaction history |

---

## Ethics Policy Enforcement Points

| Enforcement Stage       | Filter Type                          |
|------------------ |-------------------------------- |
| Pre-Listing          | Content sensitivity, privacy classification |
| Pre-Sale Approval    | Consent validation and ethics risk scoring |
| Post-Sale Audit      | Record ethical status and buyer usage terms |

---

## Pricing and Incentive Models

| Model Type          | Description                               |
|---------------- |------------------------------------ |
| Fixed Price         | Static price per data asset              |
| Auction-Based       | Dynamic market-driven pricing           |
| Reputation-Weighted | Higher rewards for high-trust nodes and users |
| Tokidao Tokenization | Payments via internal token economy layer |

---

## Extensibility

- Support for external decentralized marketplaces (e.g., Ocean Protocol)
- Cross-node data aggregation for federated asset listings
- AI-driven pricing recommendation engine (future phase)
- Smart contract-based transaction enforcement
