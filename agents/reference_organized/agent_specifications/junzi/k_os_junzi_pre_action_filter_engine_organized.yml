# kOS JUNZI Pre-Action Filter Engine

## Overview
The **kOS JUNZI Pre-Action Filter Engine (JPAFE)** is the real-time ethical decision gatekeeper embedded within the execution path of every kOS agent, skill, and system function. It enforces pre-action ethical validation using the principles and risk scoring models defined in the HIEROS Ethical Alignment Protocol.

JUNZI stands for **Judgment Unit for Non-harmful, Just, and Intention-Aligned actions**.

## Core Functions

| Function                     | Purpose                                      |
|-------------------------- |------------------------------------------- |
| Pre-Execution Risk Assessment | Evaluate ethical risk before any agent action runs |
| Policy Enforcement          | Block, allow, or modify actions based on configured ethical policies |
| Contextual Sensitivity Filtering | Factor in real-time user, system, and environmental context |
| Decision Logging             | Write every ethics decision to the audit trail |
| Exception Handling           | Define override paths for edge cases (human-approved only) |

---

## Ethical Evaluation Flow

1. **Action Proposal:** Agent or skill requests to execute a specific action
2. **Context Snapshot:** JUNZI captures current user state, system state, and environment
3. **Ethical Risk Scoring:** Use HIEROS risk model to calculate threat levels across Seven Intentions dimensions
4. **Policy Check:** Compare risk levels against configured ethical thresholds
5. **Decision Enforcement:** Allow, block, modify, or escalate action
6. **Logging and Notification:** Record decision details and notify any required observers or systems

## Decision Outcomes

| Outcome Type         | Description                                |
|------------------ |------------------------------------- |
| Allow              | Action proceeds as requested          |
| Modify             | Action parameters adjusted to reduce risk |
| Block              | Action halted, agent notified          |
| Escalate           | Forward decision to higher-level ethics reviewer (e.g., Junzi Node) |
| Require Consent    | Pause action and await explicit user consent |

---

## Risk Scoring Inputs

| Input Category        | Example Data Points                      |
|------------------- |------------------------------------ |
| User State           | Consent status, vulnerability flags |
| System Load          | Current CPU/memory/network status   |
| Recent Ethics History | Recent violations or override incidents |
| Action Category      | Type of action (e.g., data access, external communication, skill execution) |
| Node Class Context   | Current node's primary class and role |

---

## Policy Configuration

| Policy Type           | Configuration Options                     |
|------------------- |------------------------------------- |
| Global Ethics Thresholds | System-wide risk level caps         |
| Node Class-Specific Rules | Allow different filters per Node Class |
| User-Customized Policies | Personalized ethics sensitivity per user |
| Contextual Overrides | Dynamic adjustment based on environmental conditions |

---

## API Endpoints (Internal Use)

| Method | Endpoint                | Purpose                              |
|------ |--------------------- |--------------------------------- |
| POST  | `/junzi/evaluate_action` | Submit action for ethical evaluation |
| GET   | `/junzi/policy_status`  | View active policy thresholds        |
| POST  | `/junzi/override_request` | Submit manual override for human approval |
| GET   | `/junzi/risk_model_info` | Retrieve current ethical scoring model |

---

## Developer Responsibilities

| Responsibility        | Required For...                     |
|------------------ |------------------------------- |
| Ethics Impact Annotations | All agent actions subject to ethical filtering |
| Parameter Sensitivity Labels | All API input parameters affecting risk level |
| Logging Integration | All decisions must trigger audit log events |
| Fail-Safe Defaults   | All agents must assume "Block" on JUNZI failure or timeouts |

---

## Performance Considerations

- Millisecond-scale response times for low-latency operations
- Async batch mode for high-volume, non-critical tasks
- Graceful fallback with default block behavior on system error

---

## Extensibility

- Pluggable policy engine modules
- Support for future AI-enhanced ethical reasoning models
- Real-time user feedback loop for continuous ethics learning

---

The **kOS JUNZI Pre-Action Filter Engine (JPAFE)** is the last ethical checkpoint before any action is executed across the kOS ecosystem, ensuring that every agent act aligns with user consent, ethical standards, and system integrity at runtime.
