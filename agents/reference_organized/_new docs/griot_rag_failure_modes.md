title: "Griot RAG Failure Modes and Recovery Strategies"
description: |
  Catalog of known failure modes in the Griot RAG system within kOS and recommended recovery procedures for each.

failure_modes:
  - failure: "Vector Database Outage"
    impact: "RAG queries fail or return stale data"
    recovery:
      - Failover to backup vector DB
      - Notify Node Admin
      - Initiate warm storage restore

  - failure: "API Rate Limit Breach"
    impact: "Agents receive 429 errors"
    recovery:
      - Trigger backoff-and-retry logic in agents
      - Adjust rate limits if systemic

  - failure: "Query Timeout"
    impact: "Agent receives delayed or no RAG result"
    recovery:
      - Retry with reduced query scope
      - Fallback to local agent cache
      - Alert Node Admin if persistent

  - failure: "Embedding Service Crash"
    impact: "New document contributions fail"
    recovery:
      - Switch to secondary embedding backend
      - Requeue failed documents for later ingestion

  - failure: "Corrupted Vector Index"
    impact: "Query accuracy drops significantly"
    recovery:
      - Rebuild index from cold storage
      - Validate integrity with health checker

future_failure_mitigation:
  - Proactive anomaly detection (Skald integration)
  - Agent-aware dynamic failover policies
  - Load-based auto-throttling to prevent overload
