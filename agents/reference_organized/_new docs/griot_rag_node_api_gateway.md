title: "Griot RAG Node API Gateway Design"
description: |
  Architecture and configuration for the API Gateway layer that manages external and internal agent access to the Griot RAG services within kOS.

api_gateway_roles:
  - Request Routing
  - Authentication and Authorization
  - Rate Limiting
  - Load Balancing
  - API Version Management

technology_stack:
  preferred:
    - FastAPI
    - gRPC (internal high-speed agent communication)
  optional:
    - GraphQL (for flexible multi-parameter queries)
    - NGINX Reverse Proxy

endpoint_types:
  - Public Agent API
  - Internal Node-to-Node Federation API
  - Admin API

routing_rules:
  - Agent queries → RAG Query Engine
  - Agent contributions → RAG Ingestion Service
  - Federation queries → Federation Orchestrator
  - Admin tools → Monitoring & Control Panel

security_features:
  - API key validation
  - Bearer token support
  - IP-based throttling (optional)
  - TLS encryption for external traffic

scalability:
  - Horizontal gateway scaling
  - Async request handling
  - Dynamic endpoint registration for new kOS modules

future_features:
  - AI-driven traffic shaping
  - Auto-discovery of new agent endpoints
  - Integrated observability plugins
