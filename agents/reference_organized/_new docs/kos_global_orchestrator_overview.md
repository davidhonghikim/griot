title: "kOS Global Orchestrator Overview"
description: |
  High-level specification for the Global Orchestrator Layer in kOS. The Orchestrator coordinates multi-node, multi-agent operations across all node classes and modules, ensuring task distribution, resource management, cross-node messaging, and system-wide coherence.

orchestrator_identity:
  name: "kOS Global Orchestrator"
  role: "Federated AI Coordination Layer"
  scope: "Full-system control and scheduling layer for all nodes, agents, and modules"

primary_functions:
  - Multi-node task orchestration
  - Agent scheduling and load balancing
  - Cross-node event propagation
  - Global configuration management
  - Federation-wide health monitoring
  - Distributed logging and audit collection

orchestration_modes:
  - Centralized Mode (single orchestrator node)
  - Federated Mode (multi-orchestrator peer network)
  - Hybrid Mode (regionally distributed orchestrators)

key_modules:
  - Node Health Monitor
  - Task Distribution Engine
  - Federation State Manager
  - Configuration Sync Engine
  - Global Event Bus Controller

api_endpoints:
  - /schedule_global_task
  - /get_federation_health
  - /sync_global_config
  - /broadcast_event
  - /get_task_distribution_status

future_extensions:
  - AI-driven workload prediction
  - Self-healing orchestration with auto-mitigation routines
  - Cross-federation orchestrator mesh networking

security:
  - Node registration and authentication
  - Quorum-based state changes for critical updates
  - Encrypted inter-orchestrator communication

version:
  current_phase: "kOS Global Orchestrator Layer v1.0 YAML Release"
