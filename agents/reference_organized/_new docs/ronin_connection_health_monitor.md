title: "Ronin Connection Health Monitor"
description: |
  Specification for the Connection Health Monitor module within the Ronin Node Class for kOS. This module continuously evaluates the stability, latency, and throughput of all active network links.

module_identity:
  name: "Connection Health Monitor"
  belongs_to: "Ronin Node"

monitoring_metrics:
  - Round-trip time (RTT)
  - Packet loss rate
  - Bandwidth throughput
  - Jitter
  - Signal-to-noise ratio (for wireless links)

health_scoring:
  - Composite health score per link (0-100 scale)
  - Trend analysis over time
  - Failure prediction model (optional ML-based)

api_endpoints:
  - /get_link_health
  - /get_link_latency
  - /get_link_throughput
  - /get_link_health_score

alerting:
  - Health threshold breach notifications to Node Admin
  - Option for agent-triggered on-demand link health checks

data_storage:
  - Time-series database (InfluxDB, Prometheus, or SQLite)
  - Retention policy: 30 days (default)

future_extensions:
  - AI-driven anomaly detection
  - Link recovery recommendation engine
  - Auto-healing scripts for critical paths
