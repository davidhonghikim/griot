  role: "Execution Authority, Action Coordination, and High-Stakes Operations Node"
  description: |
    Archon nodes serve as the primary execution layer for decision implementation, strategic command, and operational oversight across the kOS ecosystem. Acting as commanders, coordinators, and operational directors, Archons translate approved policies, forecasts, and leadership directives into actionable plans and task execution streams. They handle time-critical actions, system-wide deployments, and high-stakes decision enforcement.
