ronin\_class: name: "Ronin" role: "Network Pathfinding, Communication Routing, Autonomous Connectivity, and Mesh Infrastructure Node" description: | Ronin nodes are the autonomous network explorers and path optimizers of the kOS ecosystem. They specialize in network discovery, dynamic topology mapping, route optimization, and mesh communication. Ronin agents establish and maintain resilient connectivity across dynamic and unreliable network topologiesâ€”including LoRa, Reticulum, ad-hoc Wi-Fi, satellite relays, and future emergent mesh networking protocols.

```
Ronins work closely with Griot nodes to access network discovery maps, deployment recipes, and protocol translation libraries stored in the AI-Q Knowledge Library. They enable connectivity for new node deployments, maintain route stability, and serve as the dynamic backbone for decentralized communication across the kOS and KLF ecosystems. Ronins are critical for off-grid deployments and in disaster recovery scenarios where centralized infrastructure has failed.
