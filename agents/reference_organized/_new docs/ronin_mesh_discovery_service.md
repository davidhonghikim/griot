title: "Ronin Mesh Discovery Service"
description: |
  Specification for the Mesh Discovery Service module within the Ronin Node Class for kOS. This service is responsible for continuous discovery and awareness of neighboring nodes in dynamic, decentralized network environments.

module_identity:
  name: "Mesh Discovery Service"
  belongs_to: "Ronin Node"

functions:
  - Passive neighbor discovery (via Reticulum broadcasts)
  - Active discovery (ping sweeps, link probes)
  - Node capability enumeration (bandwidth, storage, agent classes available)
  - Discovery frequency adjustment based on network load

output_data:
  - Live neighbor list
  - Link stability scores
  - Node class inventory

api_endpoints:
  - /get_neighbor_list
  - /get_node_capabilities
  - /trigger_mesh_scan

privacy_and_security:
  - Optional discovery anonymity
  - Trust score calculation for unknown nodes
  - Rate limiting for discovery pings

future_extensions:
  - Federation-wide node directory integration
  - Autonomous mesh density balancing
  - AI-driven neighbor selection for routing
