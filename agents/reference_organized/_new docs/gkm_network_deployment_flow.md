title: "kOS GKM Network Deployment Flow"
version: "1.0"
status: "DRAFT"
date: "2025-06-29"

deployment_flow:
  - step: "Provision Infrastructure"
    actions:
      - "Launch cloud VPS instances or local servers for each Griot and agent node"
      - "Allocate ports and IP addresses"
      - "Set up internal Reticulum links where available"

  - step: "Install Dependencies"
    actions:
      - "Install Node.js, Docker, and Reticulum runtime on each node"
      - "Pull required vector databases (Weaviate, pgvector, etc.)"
      - "Start MongoDB and Neo4j instances"

  - step: "Distribute Configuration"
    actions:
      - "Deploy environment variable templates (.env) to each node"
      - "Apply node-specific configurations (Node ID, trust level, etc.)"
      - "Configure Reticulum node identities and keys"

  - step: "Start Core Services"
    actions:
      - "Start each Griot node"
      - "Launch supporting nodes (Ronin, Musa, Tohunga, etc.)"
      - "Bring up Reticulum KLF Transport Adapters"
      - "Start CRDT sync services"

  - step: "Federation Bootstrap"
    actions:
      - "Broadcast initial NODE_ANNOUNCE from each node"
      - "Run mesh-wide NODE_DISCOVER_REQUEST"
      - "Validate that Node Registry updates across the federation"

  - step: "Health Verification"
    actions:
      - "Run mesh health check script"
      - "Ping all nodes for latency measurements"
      - "Run federated vector query test from a Skald node"

  - step: "Load Test (Optional)"
    actions:
      - "Execute synthetic load scenarios using test dataset"
      - "Monitor performance via Mesh Health Monitor"

conclusion:
  summary: "This deployment flow ensures that all nodes, transport layers, databases, and registry services are properly configured and operational before initiating full production GKM knowledge federation."
