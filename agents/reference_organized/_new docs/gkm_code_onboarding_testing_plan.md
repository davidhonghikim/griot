developer\_onboarding\_guide: prerequisites: - "Familiarity with TypeScript and Node.js" - "Basic understanding of Reticulum networking" - "Working Docker environment" - "Access to kOS core repository"

setup\_steps: - "Clone the kOS repository" - "Install dependencies: npm install" - "Setup Weaviate, MongoDB, Neo4j, Reticulum (optional for testing)" - "Configure .env variables for local environment"

workflow: - "Pick a module from the Task List" - "Work in feature branches: feature/gkm-{module\_name}" - "Submit pull requests with linked YAML spec" - "Run full test suite before PR submission"

documentation: - "Keep YAML spec and TypeScript code in sync" - "Document module-level README for each new service"

coding\_standards: - "Use strict TypeScript typing" - "Follow ESLint and Prettier configs" - "Use KLF schema definitions for message structures"

test\_coverage\_plan: test\_categories: - "Unit Tests: Per service method" - "Integration Tests: Full data flow between modules" - "E2E Tests: Simulate multi-node federated queries" - "Load Tests: Stress vector search and message routing" - "Chaos Tests: Node failures, partitions, recovery"

test\_targets: - Reticulum Adapter: - "Serialization tests" - "Encryption integrity checks" - "Reticulum frame delivery simulation" - Federated Query Service: - "Multi-node result aggregation" - "Latency under load" - Node Discovery Registry: - "Node registration and lookup" - "Node health check accuracy" - CRDT Sync: - "Eventual consistency under conflict" - "Vector and persona mutation sync" - Mesh Health Monitor: - "Topology graph accuracy" - "Latency monitoring reliability"

tools: - "Jest for unit testing" - "K6 or Artillery for load testing" - "Docker Compose for multi-node integration tests" - "Custom chaos scripts for network partition simulation"

conclusion: summary: | This combined scaffold, onboarding, and QA plan ensures all developers working on kOS GKM can implement, test, and deploy modules consistently and efficiently. This setup will also help maintain high code quality and operational reliability during multi-node and federated deployments. status: "Ready for engineering execution"
