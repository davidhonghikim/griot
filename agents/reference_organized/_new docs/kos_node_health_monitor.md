title: "kOS Node Health Monitor"
description: |
  Specification for the Node Health Monitor module within the kOS Global Orchestrator Layer. This component monitors the operational status, performance, and resource usage of all nodes participating in the kOS federation.

module_identity:
  name: "Node Health Monitor"
  belongs_to: "kOS Global Orchestrator"

functions:
  - Monitor CPU, memory, disk, and network utilization for each node
  - Track node uptime and availability status
  - Detect node failures, unresponsiveness, or degraded performance
  - Aggregate and expose node health metrics
  - Generate health status reports for admin agents

api_endpoints:
  - /get_node_health
  - /subscribe_node_health_events
  - /trigger_node_health_check
  - /get_health_summary_dashboard

monitoring_metrics:
  - CPU utilization percentage
  - Memory usage (MB and percentage)
  - Disk I/O and free space
  - Network throughput and error rates
  - Process uptime and restart counts

alerting_and_notifications:
  - Threshold-based alert triggers
  - Federation-wide node outage notifications
  - Health anomaly detection alerts

future_extensions:
  - AI-driven failure prediction
  - Auto-remediation triggers for failing nodes
  - Federated node health scoring and ranking

security:
  - Health data access control by agent role
  - Audit logging of all health monitoring actions
  - Rate limiting on frequent status pulls
