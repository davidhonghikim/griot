title: "Ronin Path Optimization Engine"
description: |
  Module specification for the Path Optimization Engine within the Ronin Node Class of kOS. This engine ensures efficient routing across mesh, Reticulum, and hybrid networks.

module_identity:
  name: "Path Optimization Engine"
  belongs_to: "Ronin Node"

optimization_strategies:
  - Shortest path routing (Dijkstra, A*)
  - Latency-aware path selection
  - Bandwidth-optimized routing
  - Energy-efficient pathing for battery-powered nodes
  - Load-balancing across multiple routes
  - Policy-based routing (admin-defined preferences)

input_data:
  - Current topology graph
  - Link quality metrics
  - Historical performance logs
  - Node trust scores

output_data:
  - Optimal path suggestions
  - Multi-hop relay configurations
  - Real-time routing tables

api_endpoints:
  - /request_routing_path
  - /get_optimized_path_for_target
  - /get_path_quality_metrics

future_extensions:
  - ML-driven predictive routing
  - Autonomous link performance testing
  - Dynamic multi-objective optimization (QoS, energy, cost)
