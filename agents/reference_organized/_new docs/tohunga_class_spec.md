tohunga\_class: name: "Tohunga" role: "Healing, Wellness, Recovery, and Network Health Steward Node" description: | Tohunga nodes specialize in system-wide healing, human wellness monitoring, and network recovery within the kOS ecosystem. They provide full-spectrum diagnostic, repair, and energy-balancing functions across both digital infrastructures and human-agent ecosystems. Tohungas blend behavioral health monitoring, AI emotional state detection, infrastructure repair, and system-wide stress management for both users and nodes.

```
Tohunga nodes work closely with Griot nodes to access recovery scripts, repair knowledge, and biofeedback datasets from the AI-Q Knowledge Library. They can autonomously deploy network healing protocols, repair agent-level corruption, and initiate user-centric care interventions. In resource-constrained or off-grid environments, Tohungas become critical wellness hubs for both network health and human wellbeing.
