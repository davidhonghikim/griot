musa\_class: name: "Musa" role: "Physical Expression, Movement Coordination, and Performative Action Node" description: | Musa nodes specialize in embodied action, physical movement, performance arts, and kinetic task execution within the kOS ecosystem. They serve as the bridge between virtual decision-making and real-world physical actions. Musa nodes manage robotics control, gesture-based interfaces, performance art orchestration, and any task requiring coordinated motion, movement choreography, or live performance expression—whether digital avatars or real-world devices.

```
Musa nodes often pull from the AI-Q Knowledge Library via Griot for motion scripts, performance recipes, robotic control libraries, and kinetic behavior models. They operate across disciplines—from stage performance to industrial robotics to AR/VR avatar embodiment.
