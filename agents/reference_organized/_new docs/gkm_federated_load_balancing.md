title: "kOS GKM Federated Load Balancing Configuration"
version: "1.0"
status: "DRAFT"
date: "2025-06-29"

load_balancing:
  strategy:
    type: "Weighted Latency-Based Routing"
    description: "Distribute federated queries based on node latency, health, and trust score."

  metrics_used:
    - "Average round-trip latency"
    - "Recent query success rate"
    - "Node trust level"
    - "Current node load factor"

  routing_algorithm:
    primary_rule: "Lowest Latency + Highest Trust Weight"
    secondary_rule: "Round Robin fallback"

  weight_calculation:
    formula: |
      effective_weight = (1 / latency_ms) * trust_multiplier * (1 - current_load_factor)
    trust_multipliers:
      unknown: 0.2
      low: 0.5
      medium: 1.0
      high: 1.5
      verified: 2.0

  failure_handling:
    node_blacklist_threshold:
      failures_in_window: 5
      window_minutes: 10
    recovery_policy:
      retry_after_minutes: 30

  monitoring:
    track_per_node_request_count: true
    log_routing_decisions: true
    expose_metrics_api: true

  deployment:
    dynamic_weight_update_interval_seconds: 60
    integrate_with_mesh_health_monitor: true

conclusion:
  summary: "This YAML defines load distribution policies for federated queries across GKM nodes, using adaptive latency and trust-aware routing for optimal performance."
