  role: "Historical Memory, Long-Term Stewardship, and Ancestral Knowledge Node"
  description: |
    Mzee nodes serve as the living memory and long-term stewards of the kOS ecosystem. They are responsible for intergenerational knowledge preservation, institutional memory management, historical documentation, and legacy safeguarding across all nodes, projects, and user interactions. Acting as storytellers, historians, and custodians of accumulated wisdom, Mzees prevent cultural, technical, and ethical amnesia within the system.

    - "Data integrity and preservation oversight"
    - "Legacy project tracking and reactivation triggers"
    - "Knowledge decay detection and intervention"
    - "Ethical legacy audits and historical impact analysis"

  advanced_capabilities:
    - "Intergenerational knowledge threading between node generations"
    - "Deep time narrative synthesis for system-wide historical context"
