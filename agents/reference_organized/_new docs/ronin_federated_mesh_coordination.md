title: "Ronin Federated Mesh Coordination"
description: |
  Architectural specification for how Ronin Nodes coordinate with each other across federated kOS deployments, enabling cross-node discovery, routing, and resource sharing.

federation_modes:
  - Loose Federation (asynchronous discovery)
  - Tight Federation (synchronous state sharing)
  - Cross-Domain Federation (multi-kOS instance integration)

coordination_protocols:
  - Reticulum Packet Routing
  - gRPC Node-to-Node Channels
  - Optional: WebRTC for high-bandwidth scenarios

federation_functions:
  - Cross-node topology aggregation
  - Multi-node routing path calculation
  - Remote link health polling
  - Federation-wide node inventory tracking

api_endpoints:
  - /federation_get_node_list
  - /federation_get_cross_node_path
  - /federation_get_link_health_remote

consistency_and_synchronization:
  - Eventual consistency for low-priority state
  - Quorum voting for critical path decisions
  - Periodic sync intervals (default: 5 minutes)

security:
  - Node identity signing and verification
  - Encrypted federation communication channels
  - Federation membership whitelist

future_expansion:
  - Cross-federation relay marketplaces
  - Incentivized uptime rewards
  - Federation-level trust graphs
