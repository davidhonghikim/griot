title: "Griot RAG Future Extensions and R&D Roadmap"
description: |
  Proposed research and development directions for enhancing the Griot RAG system in kOS beyond initial deployment.

future_features:
  - Streaming RAG Responses for long documents
  - Agent feedback-based relevance tuning
  - Hierarchical Indexing (multi-level context granularity)
  - Real-time collaborative multi-agent querying
  - Memory-augmented RAG (link RAG results to Agent Memory Modules)

research_topics:
  - Fine-tuning embedding models for domain-specific relevance
  - Vector compression techniques for storage efficiency
  - Knowledge graph overlay on top of RAG results
  - Agent-driven reinforcement learning for better query formulation
  - Energy-efficient vector search on low-resource devices

integration_expansions:
  - Direct LLM-based answer synthesis from top-K chunks
  - Conversational RAG with session continuity tracking
  - Skald-triggered auto-rephrasing of agent queries

cross_kos_features:
  - Federated RAG learning (Nodes exchange vector updates)
  - Shared RAG dashboards for Node Admins
  - Node reward system for high-quality contributions (tokenomics-linked)
