title: "kOS Task Distribution Engine"
description: |
  Specification for the Task Distribution Engine module within the kOS Global Orchestrator Layer. This component manages intelligent allocation and dispatch of tasks to appropriate nodes and agents across the kOS federation.

module_identity:
  name: "Task Distribution Engine"
  belongs_to: "kOS Global Orchestrator"

functions:
  - Evaluate task requirements and resource demands
  - Match tasks to suitable nodes and agents
  - Balance workloads across underutilized and overutilized nodes
  - Track task execution lifecycle and completion status
  - Handle priority and time-sensitive task escalation

scheduling_algorithms:
  - Round-robin
  - Resource-weighted distribution
  - Latency-aware placement
  - Priority queueing for critical tasks

api_endpoints:
  - /submit_global_task
  - /get_task_queue_status
  - /cancel_global_task
  - /get_task_execution_logs

monitoring_and_reporting:
  - Task success/failure rates
  - Average task wait time
  - Node task load distribution graphs

future_extensions:
  - AI-driven task placement optimization
  - Task dependency resolution and DAG execution support
  - Federation-wide distributed job queuing

security:
  - Task submission authentication
  - Execution authorization by agent role
  - Logging of task scheduling decisions
