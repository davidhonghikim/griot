title: "CRDT and Eventual Consistency Sync Service Specification"
version: "1.0"
status: "DRAFT"
date: "2025-06-29"

overview:
  description: |
    This document defines the CRDT/Eventual Consistency Sync Service for synchronizing knowledge state across Griot nodes in the kOS Global Knowledge Mesh (GKM). It ensures all nodes reach consistent vector, persona, and document states over time.

objectives:
  - "Enable state synchronization across distributed Griot nodes"
  - "Handle vector updates, persona changes, and document mutations"
  - "Provide conflict resolution and rollback capabilities"

sync_targets:
  - "VectorStore indexes"
  - "MongoDB persona documents"
  - "Neo4j graph relationships"
  - "File-based document repositories (optional phase 2)"

sync_mechanisms:
  initial_phase: "Last-Write-Wins (LWW)"
  future_phase: "CRDT Mergeable States"
  data_flow:
    - "Track vector and persona mutations via event log"
    - "Push updates to subscribed peer nodes"
    - "On receipt, apply LWW logic or CRDT merge"
    - "Support batch and streaming modes"

api_endpoints:
  - name: "POST /sync/push"
    description: "Push local updates to a remote node"
    body: "Array of SyncEvent objects"

  - name: "POST /sync/pull"
    description: "Request updates since a given sync timestamp"
    body:
      - "last_sync_time: ISO8601 timestamp"
      - "data_types: optional filters (vector, persona, graph)"

  - name: "POST /sync/resolve-conflict"
    description: "Manually resolve a detected conflict"
    body:
      - "conflictId: string"
      - "resolutionStrategy: enum (prefer_local, prefer_remote, manual_merge)"

sync_event_schema:
  fields:
    - event_id: "UUID"
    - timestamp: "ISO8601 timestamp"
    - event_type: "Enum: vector_update, persona_update, document_update, graph_update"
    - target_id: "string"
    - payload: "JSON object with change details"

conflict_detection:
  - "Vector timestamp mismatch"
  - "Persona document version mismatch"
  - "Graph relationship divergence"

performance_targets:
  - "Sync propagation delay: <2 seconds (LAN), <10 seconds (WAN)"
  - "Eventual consistency window: <60 seconds under normal conditions"

security_and_reliability:
  - "All sync messages signed using KLF signatures"
  - "Encrypted transport layer"
  - "Failure recovery with event replay"
  - "Audit logging for all sync operations"

deployment_plan:
  - "Phase 1: Intra-node LWW sync on local network"
  - "Phase 2: Cross-node sync with CRDT merge support"
  - "Phase 3: Full federation-wide state convergence"

conclusion:
  summary: |
    This sync service will provide a scalable, fault-tolerant, and trustable mechanism for maintaining consistent knowledge states across the GKM, ensuring high availability and low data drift.
