title: "Ronin Node Class Overview"
description: |
  High-level and low-level technical specification for the Ronin Node Class in kOS. Ronin is the autonomous, decentralized, nomadic network explorer and connectivity specialist within the Kind AI Operating System (kOS) ecosystem.

node_identity:
  class_name: "Ronin"
  archetype: "Nomadic Starseed"
  primary_role: "Network Discovery, Pathfinding, Topology Mapping, and Inter-node Routing"

functional_scope:
  - Reticulum network discovery and mapping
  - Mesh network routing optimization
  - Link health monitoring
  - Connection fallback handling (LoRa, Wi-Fi, Ethernet, Satellite, etc.)
  - Auto-configuration of network interfaces
  - Dynamic bandwidth and latency estimation
  - Opportunistic relay services

core_modules:
  - Network Topology Mapper
  - Path Optimization Engine
  - Failover and Redundancy Manager
  - Connection Health Monitor
  - Mesh Discovery Service
  - Routing Policy Engine

communication_protocols:
  - Reticulum
  - LoRaWAN
  - Ethernet
  - Wi-Fi
  - TCP/IP
  - WebRTC (optional for high-bandwidth peers)
  - Bluetooth LE (optional)

agent_interaction:
  api_endpoints:
    - /get_topology_map
    - /get_link_health
    - /request_routing_path
    - /force_link_failover
    - /broadcast_heartbeat

security:
  - Encrypted peer-to-peer communication
  - Node identity verification using cryptographic keys
  - Rate-limiting on broadcast services
  - Isolation of untrusted nodes

scalability:
  - Horizontal scaling across physical nodes
  - Support for federated and hybrid networking (Internet + LoRa + Mesh)

future_extensions:
  - AI-driven pathfinding based on network conditions
  - Dynamic relay election among Ronin nodes
  - Incentivized network uptime (tokenomics-enabled)

version:
  current: "Ronin v1.0 YAML Release"
