title: "Skald-Griot RAG Live Stream Adapter"
description: |
  Specification for the Live Stream Adapter module enabling Skald to process streaming RAG query results from Griot in real time, generating incremental narrative outputs for agents or external interfaces.

module_identity:
  name: "Skald-Griot RAG Live Stream Adapter"
  belongs_to: "Skald Node"

functions:
  - Listen to Griot RAG streaming API endpoints
  - Incrementally build narratives from incoming RAG chunks
  - Enable partial or progressive content delivery to agents
  - Support real-time editing or interrupt/resume of narrative assembly

streaming_modes:
  - Token-streaming (word-by-word generation)
  - Chunk-streaming (paragraph by paragraph)
  - Event-driven streaming (agent-defined checkpoints)

api_endpoints:
  - /start_rag_stream
  - /stop_rag_stream
  - /get_streaming_status
  - /streamed_narrative_chunk

future_extensions:
  - AI-driven stream quality control
  - Real-time agent feedback loop for stream adjustment
  - Federation-wide multi-source RAG streaming aggregation

security:
  - Stream authentication tokens
  - Agent-specific stream rate limits
  - Logging of stream start/stop events
