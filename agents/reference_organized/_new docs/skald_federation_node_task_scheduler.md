title: "Skald Federation Node Task Scheduler"
description: |
  Specification for the Federation Node Task Scheduler module within the Skald Node Class for kOS. This module handles intelligent scheduling and distribution of narrative and media generation tasks across multiple Skald nodes in a federation.

module_identity:
  name: "Federation Node Task Scheduler"
  belongs_to: "Skald Node"

functions:
  - Load balancing narrative and media jobs across nodes
  - Scheduling tasks based on node health, latency, and queue depth
  - Prioritizing time-sensitive narrative tasks
  - Supporting deferred, batch, and real-time job distribution

scheduling_policies:
  - Least-loaded node first
  - Latency-optimized routing
  - Content-type specialization (e.g., audio-heavy tasks to audio-optimized nodes)

api_endpoints:
  - /federation_schedule_task
  - /get_node_load_status
  - /rebalance_task_queues
  - /cancel_federation_task

metrics_and_monitoring:
  - Task success/failure rates per node
  - Node load heatmaps
  - Queue depth tracking

future_extensions:
  - AI-driven predictive load forecasting
  - Federation-wide job dependency mapping
  - Multi-cloud Skald federation task routing

security:
  - Task assignment authorization
  - Task execution audit trails
  - Rate-limiting on task reassignment calls
