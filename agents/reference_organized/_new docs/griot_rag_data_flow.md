title: "Griot RAG Data Flow within kOS"
description: |
  Detailed data flow for RAG operations inside the Griot Node for multi-agent querying and contribution within the kOS architecture.

data_flow:
  ingest:
    source:
      - External Documents (MD, YAML, PDF, etc)
      - Agent Generated Context
    steps:
      - Text Cleaning and Normalization
      - Embedding Generation
      - Vector Index Insertion
      - Metadata Annotation

  query:
    trigger:
      - Agent Query via API
    steps:
      - Query Tokenization
      - Embedding Generation
      - Vector Similarity Search
      - Chunk Retrieval
      - Scoring and Ranking
      - Response Packaging

  contribution:
    trigger:
      - Agent / Node Admin Upload
    steps:
      - Document Parsing
      - Embedding Creation
      - Index Update
      - Metadata Logging

  post-processing:
    optional:
      - Re-ranking by LLM Scoring
      - Post-query Filtering
      - Custom Response Templating by Skald or relevant Agent Class

  logging:
    actions:
      - Query Log
      - Contribution Log
      - API Usage Metrics

monitoring:
  tools:
    - Prometheus Exporter (Optional)
    - Healthcheck Endpoints
    - Vector Database Stats API

future_optimizations:
  - Asynchronous Batch Query Support
  - Cross-Agent Query Optimization
  - Knowledge Graph Layer Integration
