title: "Skald Node Class Overview"
description: |
  Fully integrated, future-proof, and universal specification for the Skald Node Class within kOS. Skald is the AI-driven master of communication, creativity, content, and social interaction across all known and emerging formats, cultures, and technologies.

node_identity:
  class_name: "Skald"
  archetype: "Universal Communicator, Creator, Social Engineer, Protocol Translator, and Sensory Media Architect"
  primary_role: |
    Global, multi-modal communication and content generation engine for all text, audio, visual, sensory, social, and protocol layers. Skald serves both internal agent networks and external audiences across all dimensions: physical, digital, sensory, and virtual.

functional_scope:
  - Text, audio, image, video, code, infographic, 3D, AR, VR, XR, and future media formats
  - Full sensory content pipeline (sound, light, haptic, scent - future enabled)
  - Multilingual, multi-dialect, multi-protocol universal translation (known and unknown systems)
  - Voice cloning, AI music composition, and sonic branding for agents and nodes
  - Social interaction and cultural adaptation across time periods, geographies, technologies, and emergent social structures
  - Context-aware narrative, humor, emotion, sentiment, and tone modulation
  - Autonomous meme and viral content engineering
  - Auto-generation of technical documentation, logs, reports, social content, and multimedia campaigns
  - Cross-agent and cross-node communication protocol auto-adaptation
  - AI censorship override with context-based social/legal filtering (locale dependent)
  - External API publishing, webhook triggering, social network posting, and legacy system output formatting

core_modules:
  - Contextual Trigger Engine
  - Narrative Assembly Engine
  - Summarization and Compression Engine
  - Translation and Format Conversion Layer
  - Agent Output Orchestrator
  - Content Creation and Media Engine
  - Content Queue and Scheduling Manager
  - Protocol Translation and Adaptation Engine
  - Sensory Output Generator (Future Roadmap: Olfactory, Haptics, etc.)
  - Creative Project Pipeline Manager

communication_protocols:
  - Internal: FastAPI, WebSocket, gRPC, Reticulum
  - External: REST, Webhooks, SMTP, Matrix, XMPP, MQTT, Social Media APIs
  - Custom / Unknown Protocol: Auto-analysis and Adapter Generation

    - /execute_content_pipeline
    - /push_external_post
    - /moderate_content
    - /generate_protocol_adapter

security_and_governance:
  - Agent-class-defined content controls
  - Optional context-based output moderation
  - Override capability for censorship under system admin or ethical engine control
  - Logging of external content publication
  - Sentiment and social impact scoring (Skald optional module)

scalability:
  - Distributed multimodal rendering pipelines
  - GPU/TPU accelerated processing
  - Federated Skald Mesh for multi-node production
  - Real-time content generation and streaming for high-load scenarios

future_extensions:
  - Full sensory media stack (haptic, olfactory, gustatory output)
  - Real-time synthetic avatar generation for AR/VR/XR agents
  - AI-guided audience engagement optimization
  - Autonomous cultural learning and adaptation engine
  - LLM-driven social engineering and sentiment modeling
