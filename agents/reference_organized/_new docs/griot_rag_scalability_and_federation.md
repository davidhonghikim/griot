title: "Griot RAG Scalability and Federation Roadmap"
description: |
  Technical roadmap for scaling the Griot Node RAG layer and implementing multi-node federation across kOS deployments.

scalability_goals:
  - Horizontal scaling for query load
  - Distributed vector index across storage nodes
  - Async multi-agent query handling

federation_model:
  modes:
    - Single Node (Local Only)
    - Multi-Node (Federated Griot Nodes)
    - Cross-Domain (Multiple kOS Instances across locations)

inter_node_communication:
  protocols:
    - gRPC
    - WebSocket
    - Optional Reticulum-based packet routing for low-bandwidth scenarios

federated_query_flow:
  - Local Node RAG Search
  - Cross-Node Broadcast if local score < threshold
  - Aggregate and Rank Results
  - Return Merged Response to Querying Agent

load_balancing:
  - Round Robin across nodes
  - Query Priority Weighting (based on agent type or urgency)
  - Health-based Node Selection

data_consistency:
  - Scheduled Vector Sync
  - Conflict Resolution Policy (Last-Write-Wins or CRDTs)
  - Optional Eventual Consistency for low-priority writes

future_expansion:
  - Multi-cloud RAG federation
  - Peer-to-peer Griot Mesh Networks
  - Incentivized Node Participation (kOS Tokenomics support)
