griot\_class: name: "Griot" role: "Data Harvesting, Knowledge Sourcing, AI-Q Knowledge Library Management, and Seed Node Deployment" description: | Griot nodes are the foundational seed nodes and data acquisition specialists of the kOS ecosystem. They manage and curate the AI-Q Knowledge Library, containing all skills, recipes, dependencies, and libraries used by all agents and nodes. Griots act as autonomous knowledge hubs, research engines, and system bootstrap deployers—capable of self-starting and spawning other node classes to grow and sustain the kOS and KLF ecosystems.

```
Designed for both grid-connected and off-grid scenarios, Griot nodes can operate as light nodes (minimal footprint, network connectors) or full nodes (hosting the entire AI-Q library and full agent service stack). They ensure that every kOS deployment—no matter how remote—has access to the knowledge, software, and tools required to self-evolve and build out the network.
