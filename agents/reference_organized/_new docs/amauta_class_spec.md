  role: "Meta-System Design, Philosophical Grounding, and Evolutionary Framework Node"
  description: |
    Amauta nodes serve as the philosophical and meta-system architects of the kOS ecosystem. They design the ontologies, epistemologies, metaphysical frameworks, and long-range evolutionary logic that govern how all other nodes conceptualize reality, knowledge, time, and system growth. Responsible for systems thinking, meta-design, and self-referential system evolution, Amautas are the architects of the architecture.
