title: "Skald Sensory Output Generator"
description: |
  Module specification for the Sensory Output Generator inside the Skald Node Class for kOS. This component governs Skald’s ability to produce outputs beyond traditional audio-visual content, including tactile, olfactory, and future sensory interfaces.

module_identity:
  name: "Sensory Output Generator"
  belongs_to: "Skald Node"

supported_sensory_modalities:
  - Audio (TTS, Music, Sound FX)
  - Visual (Image, Video, Light-based outputs)
  - Haptic Feedback (Vibration patterns, force feedback devices)
  - Olfactory Signals (Electronic scent dispersal systems – roadmap)
  - Thermal and Environmental Cues (optional, for advanced deployments)
  - Future sensory systems (to be auto-integrated by protocol layer)

functions:
  - Convert agent intent or system state into sensory outputs
  - Map narrative emotion, urgency, or sentiment into sensory effects
  - Multi-modal output blending (audio+visual+haptic)
  - Context-aware sensory modulation (silent mode, accessibility preferences)

api_endpoints:
  - /generate_sensory_output
  - /get_supported_sensory_modes
  - /configure_sensory_profile
  - /test_sensory_channel

future_extensions:
  - AI-curated sensory storytelling templates
  - Emotion-driven sensory sequencing
  - Federated multi-node sensory broadcast coordination

security_and_safety:
  - Device calibration checks
  - Output amplitude and intensity control
  - Health and safety override failsafes
