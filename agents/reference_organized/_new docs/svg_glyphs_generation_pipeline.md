svg\_glyphs\_generation\_pipeline: overview: | This document defines the recommended pipeline for actual SVG glyph design, AI-assisted generation, refinement, and multi-format export for all kOS and KLF ecosystem icon packs. This phase turns the YAML specs into real, deployable SVG files.

phases: 1: "Source Design Generation" steps: - "For each category batch, generate base vector drafts in Figma, Illustrator, Inkscape, or AI-based vectorizer tools (e.g., Skald Visual Engine, Vectorizer AI)." - "For AI-generated SVGs, export drafts for human review."

```
2: "Human Design QA Pass"
steps:
  - "Visual audit for consistency with the glyph specs."
  - "Fix alignment, stroke weight, and visual balance issues."
  - "Ensure theme color palettes match category specifications."

3: "SVG Optimization Phase"
tools:
  - "SVGO CLI"
  - "SVGOMG web tool"
  - "Figma SVG Export Cleaner Plugin"
actions:
  - "Minimize file size while preserving vector integrity."
  - "Remove unnecessary metadata, hidden layers, and unused IDs."

4: "Format Export"
actions:
  - "Export all target sizes (16px to 1024px) as SVG and PNG."
  - "Generate WebP for web clients."
  - "For flagged icons, animate and export Lottie JSON via After Effects with Bodymovin or Figma Lottie plugin."

5: "File Naming and Organization"
rules:
  - "Use kebab-case (lowercase, hyphen-separated) for filenames."
  - "Prefix each file with category short tag (e.g., kos-, klf-, aiq-, etc.)."
  - "Example: kos-global-network-map.svg"

6: "Version Tagging and Commit"
actions:
  - "Tag this batch as v1.0.0 in Git."
  - "Commit all optimized and exported assets under /assets/glyphs/ and /assets/glyphs-src/."

7: "Deployment Readiness Check"
checklist:
  - "Visual preview of each icon at all sizes"
  - "SVG passes W3C Validator"
  - "Test Lottie animations in web and mobile context"
  - "Confirm directory structure matches manifest"
```
