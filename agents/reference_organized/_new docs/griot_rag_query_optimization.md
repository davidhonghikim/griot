title: "Griot RAG Query Optimization Strategies"
description: |
  Techniques and design considerations to optimize RAG query performance, latency, and relevance inside Griot Node for kOS.

optimization_goals:
  - Sub-100ms latency for local queries
  - High recall and precision for semantic search
  - Minimal system resource consumption

techniques:
  - Pre-caching frequent queries
  - Asynchronous parallel vector search
  - Multi-pass retrieval (coarse then fine-grained ranking)
  - Embedding dimension reduction for faster lookups
  - Query rewriting using LLM heuristics (optional)

ranking_improvements:
  - Hybrid ranking: Dense Vector Score + Metadata Boosting
  - Context window scoring (relevance to agent's current session)
  - Temporal boosting (recent documents prioritized)

load_handling:
  - Query deduplication
  - Rate limiting under high load
  - Query batching for simultaneous agent queries

future_features:
  - Streaming query results
  - Incremental query refinement with user feedback loop
  - GPU-accelerated similarity search
