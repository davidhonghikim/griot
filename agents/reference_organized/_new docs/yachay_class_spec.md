  description: |
    Yachay nodes are the learning, training, and educational backbone of the kOS ecosystem. They specialize in knowledge management, curriculum generation, adaptive learning systems, personalized education pathways, and lifelong learning support. Acting as librarians, teachers, instructional designers, and learning AI, Yachay nodes ensure that both human users and AI agents continuously grow and adapt.
