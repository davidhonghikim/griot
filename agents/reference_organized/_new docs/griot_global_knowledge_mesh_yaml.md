title: "kOS Global Knowledge Mesh (GKM) and Griot Federation Architecture"
version: "1.0"
status: "DRAFT"
date: "2025-06-29"

overview:
  description: |
    The kOS Global Knowledge Mesh (GKM) transforms Griot from a local RAG node into a fully distributed, federated knowledge routing layer across all kOS nodes (server and clients). This allows agents anywhere in the network to query, share, and synchronize knowledge across the meshâ€”whether over HTTP, Reticulum, Tor, or future custom transports.

core_components:
  griot_global_knowledge_router_layer:
    description: "Acts as the knowledge router for all inter-node queries"
    features:
      - "Abstracts storage backend (Weaviate, Mongo, Neo4j)"
      - "Manages incoming TASK_REQUESTS from nodes/agents"
      - "Supports local-first query, with federated fallback"

  reticulum_klf_transport_adapter:
    description: "Converts KLF messages to Reticulum frames and back"
    features:
      - "Message signing and encryption over Reticulum"
      - "Implements Mesh Discovery Protocol (MDP) for node discovery"

  federated_vector_mesh_query_service:
    description: "Distributes RAG queries across Griot nodes"
    features:
      - "Local vector store query first"
      - "Federated multi-node query"
      - "Aggregation and reranking of results"
      - "TTL and priority-aware query routing"

  node_discovery_and_trust_registry:
    description: "Directory of all known kOS nodes in the mesh"
    fields:
      - "Node ID"
      - "Capabilities"
      - "Transport addresses (HTTP, Reticulum, Tor)"
      - "Trust level (future HIEROS validation)"
    functionality:
      - "Node announcement"
      - "Mesh-wide node subscription"

  crdt_eventual_consistency_sync_service:
    description: "Ensures knowledge state convergence across nodes"
    features:
      - "Vector updates synchronization"
      - "Persona and document change sync"
      - "Conflict resolution (v1: Last-Write-Wins, v2: CRDT Merge)"

  mesh_health_and_topology_monitor:
    description: "Tracks health and performance of nodes"
    metrics:
      - "Node uptime"
      - "Latency per route"
      - "Federation query success rate"
      - "Network topology mapping"
    consumer_nodes:
      - "Musa"
      - "Ronin"

network_transports:
  local_fast:
    protocol: "HTTP / WebSocket"
  mesh_layer:
    protocol: "Reticulum"
  darknet:
    protocol: "Tor Hidden Services"
  future:
    protocol: "libp2p / Custom"

query_flow:
  steps:
    - "Agent sends KLF TASK_REQUEST to local Griot"
    - "Griot performs local RAG query"
    - "If insufficient confidence, Griot federates query"
    - "Remote Griots perform RAG"
    - "Griot aggregates and reranks"
    - "Best context slice returned to agent"

security_layers:
  - "Message signing with kOS Node Keys"
  - "Optional AES-GCM / ChaCha20 payload encryption"
  - "Future: HIEROS Codex Trust Enforcement"
  - "Federated Reputation and Vouching Mechanism (future phase)"

deployment_model:
  roles:
    - primary_griot: "Knowledge Hub, orchestration center"
    - federation_peer: "Griot nodes on other hosts"
    - lightweight_client_node: "Agents with local vector cache, remote query delegation"
    - edge_node: "Reticulum-only low-resource node"

immediate_next_development_tasks:
  - "Implement Reticulum KLF Transport Adapter"
  - "Draft Federated Vector Query Service API"
  - "Build Node Registry and Discovery Microservice"
  - "Implement CRDT/Eventual Consistency Service (Phase 1: LWW)"
  - "Add Mesh Health Monitor for Musa and Ronin"
  - "Update all agents for federated Griot query support"

future_enhancements:
  - "CRDT Merge-on-Conflict strategies"
  - "Offline-first Vector Sync"
  - "Full P2P Knowledge Flooding"
  - "Reputation-weighted Query Routing"
  - "Real-time Vector Delta Streaming"
  - "Multi-hop, bandwidth-aware Knowledge Routing"

conclusion:
  summary: |
    The GKM architecture transforms kOS into a decentralized, sovereign knowledge and communication network layered over existing and custom infrastructure protocols. This design ensures scalability, resilience, and full user data sovereignty.
