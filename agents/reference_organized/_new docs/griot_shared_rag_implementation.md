title: "Shared RAG Implementation within kOS Griot Node"
description: |
  Design specification for implementing a universal, shareable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system inside the Griot Node of kOS (Kind AI Operating System), allowing all agent classes to access, query, and contribute to the same RAG knowledge layer.

context:
  system: "kOS (Kind AI Operating System)"
  primary_node: "Griot"
  target_agents: "All Node Classes (Griot, Tohunga, Ronin, Musa, Hakim, Skald, Oracle, Junzi, Yachay, Sachem, Archon, Amauta, Mzee)"

objectives:
  - Create a single RAG layer within Griot accessible via API by all agents
  - Enable universal context retrieval across all node classes
  - Allow bidirectional knowledge contribution: Agents can write to RAG
  - Include semantic search, similarity scoring, ranking, and filtering
  - Support multi-source, multi-format document ingestion (text, markdown, YAML, etc)
  - Optimize for low-latency, concurrent, multi-agent queries

architecture:
  components:
    - Vector Database (e.g., ChromaDB, Weaviate, Qdrant)
    - Embedding Service (e.g., OpenAI embeddings, Sentence Transformers)
    - FastAPI or LangChain-based RAG Orchestrator
    - API Gateway (e.g., FastAPI, gRPC, REST, GraphQL)
    - Local storage for agent-generated docs and incremental context
    - Optional caching layer (Redis, Faiss)

agent_interaction:
  api_endpoints:
    - /query_rag
    - /contribute_rag
    - /rank_results
    - /filter_results
    - /get_embeddings
  query_modes:
    - Text-based natural language
    - Programmatic keyword-based
    - Contextual document input

access_control:
  roles:
    - agent
    - node_admin
    - system_admin
  permissions:
    - Read access: All agents
    - Write access: Node-class defined policies (e.g., Griot has full write; others may have limited)
    - Admin: Schema changes, API throttling policies, etc

performance:
  - Optimized for <=100ms query latency on local networks
  - Scales horizontally across agent requests
  - Async task handling for large document ingestion

security:
  - Authenticated API tokens for all agent calls
  - Audit logging of all queries and writes
  - Role-based rate limiting

maintenance:
  - Automated vector index refresh
  - Periodic clean-up of low-relevance embeddings
  - Agent-contributed document expiration policy (optional)

future_expansion:
  - Federation across Griot nodes on different physical hosts
  - Distributed RAG layer with sharding
  - Cross-agent knowledge graph linking RAG outputs with Agent memory modules
