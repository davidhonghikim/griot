replication_modes:
  - Synchronous (write-through)
  - Asynchronous (eventual consistency)
  - Scheduled batch replication

functions:
  - Data change event tracking
  - Multi-node replication queue management
  - Conflict resolution policies (Last-Write-Wins, CRDT, etc.)
  - Bandwidth-aware replication scheduling

api_endpoints:
  - /get_replication_status
  - /trigger_replication
  - /get_replication_peers

security:
  - Encrypted inter-node replication channels
  - Node authentication for replication rights
  - Throttling controls to prevent overload
