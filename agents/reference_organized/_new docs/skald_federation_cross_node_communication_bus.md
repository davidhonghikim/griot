title: "Skald Federation Cross-Node Communication Bus"
description: |
  Specification for the Cross-Node Communication Bus inside the Skald Node Class for kOS Federation. This module enables reliable, secure, and scalable messaging between Skald nodes across distributed deployments.

module_identity:
  name: "Federation Cross-Node Communication Bus"
  belongs_to: "Skald Node"

functions:
  - Route control messages and narrative payloads between Skald nodes
  - Support synchronous and asynchronous federation messaging
  - Provide delivery guarantees (at-least-once, exactly-once options)
  - Handle network partitions and message replay

supported_protocols:
  - gRPC
  - WebSocket
  - Reticulum-based low-bandwidth packet routing
  - Optional: MQTT for lightweight federation nodes

api_endpoints:
  - /send_federation_message
  - /receive_federation_message
  - /get_federation_bus_status
  - /retry_federation_message

future_extensions:
  - AI-driven federation traffic shaping
  - Dynamic message priority reclassification
  - Federation-wide messaging QoS monitoring

security:
  - Message signing and encryption
  - Node identity verification
  - Replay protection and duplication control

scalability:
  - Horizontal scale-out of message brokers
  - Load-aware federation bus routing
