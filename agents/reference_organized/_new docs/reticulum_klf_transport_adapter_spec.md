title: "Reticulum KLF Transport Adapter Specification"
version: "1.0"
status: "DRAFT"
date: "2025-06-29"

overview:
  description: |
    The Reticulum KLF Transport Adapter enables kOS nodes to transmit and receive KLF (Kind Link Framework) messages over Reticulum mesh networks. This adapter provides a lightweight, encrypted, and delay-tolerant communication channel for distributed knowledge and coordination tasks.

objectives:
  - "Allow bi-directional KLF message transport over Reticulum"
  - "Support both small control messages and large payload chunking"
  - "Integrate with existing kOS BaseNode transport interface"
  - "Ensure message integrity, ordering, and delivery confirmation"

core_components:
  serialization_layer:
    description: "Converts KLF message objects into compact binary payloads for Reticulum transmission"
    features:
      - "Protocol Buffers or MessagePack encoding"
      - "Optional compression (e.g., LZ4, Brotli)"

  encryption_layer:
    description: "Provides end-to-end encryption for payload confidentiality"
    features:
      - "AES-GCM 256-bit encryption"
      - "Node-specific symmetric keys or pre-shared keys"

  signing_layer:
    description: "Ensures message authenticity and integrity"
    features:
      - "Ed25519-based digital signatures"
      - "Signature validation on receipt"

  fragmentation_layer:
    description: "Handles large KLF messages by splitting into multiple Reticulum frames"
    features:
      - "Chunking and reassembly logic"
      - "Sequence numbering and missing frame detection"

  adapter_api:
    interfaces:
      - "sendKLFMessageToReticulum(klfMessage: KLFMessage): Promise<void>"
      - "onReticulumMessageReceived(callback: (klfMessage: KLFMessage) => void): void"
      - "getReticulumStats(): Promise<ReticulumStats>"

node_discovery_protocol:
  name: "Mesh Discovery Protocol (MDP)"
  description: "Allows nodes to announce presence and discover peers on the Reticulum mesh"
  message_types:
    - "NODE_ANNOUNCE"
    - "NODE_DISCOVER_REQUEST"
    - "NODE_DISCOVER_RESPONSE"

performance_targets:
  - "Message serialization/deserialization < 10ms"
  - "Encryption/Decryption latency < 5ms per message"
  - "Max frame size: 128KB (Reticulum constraint)"
  - "End-to-end latency (typical): < 500ms"

error_handling:
  - "Retry logic for transient network failures"
  - "Out-of-order message handling"
  - "Message deduplication based on KLF correlation IDs"

security_considerations:
  - "Replay attack prevention with unique message IDs and nonces"
  - "DoS mitigation with rate limiting and proof-of-work for untrusted nodes"
  - "Future HIEROS Codex integration for federated trust enforcement"

deployment_plan:
  phases:
    - "Phase 1: Localhost simulated Reticulum network"
    - "Phase 2: LAN-scale mesh deployment"
    - "Phase 3: WAN and Internet overlay mesh"
    - "Phase 4: Production multi-node federation rollout"

conclusion:
  summary: |
    The Reticulum KLF Transport Adapter will enable secure, efficient, and decentralized KLF message passing over mesh networks, providing the foundational transport layer for kOS's post-internet knowledge and communication system.
  status: "Ready for engineering implementation"
