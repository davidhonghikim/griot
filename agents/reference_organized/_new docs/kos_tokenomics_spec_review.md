tokenomics: suggested\_edits: - section: "control\_mechanism" suggestion: "Add a brief explanation of how governance-controlled rate levers will be triggered and adjusted over time to improve clarity on dynamic supply control."

```
- section: "burning: triggers"
  suggestion: "Clarify whether all agent tasks have the same burn rate or if it varies by task complexity, agent class, or network conditions."

- section: "UBI: eligibility"
  suggestion: "Expand on what 'Community-Governed Identity Verification' means. Suggest including at least one practical implementation example to prevent confusion."

- section: "governance: voting"
  suggestion: "Include a short explanation of why Quadratic Voting was chosen over alternatives (e.g., one-person-one-vote, token-weighted voting) for better reader context."

- section: "user_experience: wallet_interface"
  suggestion: "Add a note on designing for accessibility and non-technical users, especially for visualizing token flows, burns, and governance participation in a user-friendly way."
```

general\_flow: suggestion: "Consider reorganizing the document to group 'Governance', 'Reputation System', and 'Anti-Sybil' under a single high-level category like 'Network Governance and Trust Layer' for better logical flow."

clarity: suggestion: "Throughout the document, briefly define unique terms at first mention (e.g., 'Echo Fade', 'Origin Bloom', 'Foundation Pulse') to help new readers without losing the lore flavor."

completeness: suggestion: "Consider adding a section on 'Economic Monitoring and Adjustment Algorithms' that explains how ongoing supply, burn rate, and UBI flows will be monitored and adjusted over time."

risk\_analysis: suggestion: "Add a short section summarizing key known economic risks (inflation spiral, Sybil attacks, governance capture) and the primary mitigation strategies already built into the model."
