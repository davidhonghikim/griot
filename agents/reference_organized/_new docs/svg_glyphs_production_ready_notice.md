  status: "SVG Glyphs and Icon Production Phase Authorized"
  next_steps:
    - "Start generating actual vector art for each glyph based on all YAML specs just completed"
    - "Use Figma, Illustrator, Inkscape, or AI Vectorization pipeline (e.g., Skald Visual Engine)"
    - "Export base drafts for review at target sizes (16px up to 1024px)"
    - "Run SVGO optimization and package per glyph spec"
    - "Commit all final .svg, .png, .webp, and .json (Lottie) files into /assets/glyphs/"
    - "Validate each batch using the Glyph Export Pipeline and Packaging Script specs already completed"
    - "Prepare for optional CI/CD deployment and end-user consumption"
  reminder: |
    Actual SVG file generation must happen in a compatible vector graphic tool or AI image-to-vector service. This document flags that all documentation phases are complete and production work on art assets can formally begin.
