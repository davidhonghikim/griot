  - id: "task-5"
    name: "Implement Mesh Health and Topology Monitor"
    objective: "Monitor node health and build network topology maps"
    subtasks:
      - "Add heartbeat and ping messages across mesh"
      - "Track node uptime, latency, error rates"
      - "Expose mesh topology graph API"
      - "Build CLI and web-based visualizers for network state"
      - "Integrate with Musa and Ronin reporting modules"

  - id: "task-6"
    name: "Agent Update for Federated Query Support"
    objective: "Make all agent classes query Griot federation-aware"
    subtasks:
      - "Update Skald, Tohunga, Musa, etc. to request federated queries"
      - "Add query fallback if local Griot unavailable"
      - "Implement context-window budget enforcement for incoming federated responses"
      - "Add persona-relevance reranking at agent level"
      - "Test multi-agent query flows under load"

next_steps:
  - "Prioritize by infrastructure readiness (start with Transport Adapter and Node Registry)"
  - "Schedule implementation sprints per task group"
  - "Write API specs for each service"
  - "Draft test plans for multi-node simulation"
  - "Design federation fallback and error handling workflows"

conclusion: "This breakdown ensures sequential and parallelizable workstreams for full GKM deployment across kOS."
