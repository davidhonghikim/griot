title: "Griot RAG Index Maintenance Procedures"
description: |
  Routine and automated maintenance tasks for preserving the performance, integrity, and relevance of the Griot RAG vector index inside kOS.

maintenance_tasks:
  - task: Vector Re-indexing
    frequency: "Weekly or after large document ingests"
    details: "Rebuild vector index from source embeddings to optimize search accuracy"

  - task: Stale Embedding Pruning
    frequency: "Monthly"
    details: "Remove outdated or low-scoring embeddings to reduce index bloat"

  - task: Embedding Drift Detection
    frequency: "Bi-Weekly"
    details: "Run similarity audits to detect vector drift vs. source documents"

  - task: Index Compaction
    frequency: "After every 10k new documents"
    details: "Compact and defragment vector index to maintain query speed"

  - task: Backup Validation
    frequency: "Weekly"
    details: "Run restore tests to validate backup integrity"

  - task: Query Latency Monitoring
    frequency: "Continuous (Prometheus Exporter Recommended)"
    details: "Monitor query response times and trigger alerts on threshold breaches"
