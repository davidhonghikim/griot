title: "Skald Federation Narrative Orchestrator"
description: |
  Specification for the Federation Narrative Orchestrator within the Skald Node Class for kOS. This module enables cross-node coordination of narrative generation, messaging, and multimedia content production across a distributed Skald Mesh.

module_identity:
  name: "Federation Narrative Orchestrator"
  belongs_to: "Skald Node"

functions:
  - Coordinate narrative tasks across multiple Skald nodes in a federation
  - Distribute content generation workloads
  - Aggregate multi-node narratives into unified outputs
  - Manage content consistency and delivery across nodes
  - Support cross-node failover for narrative tasks

federation_modes:
  - Loose Federation (asynchronous narrative aggregation)
  - Tight Federation (synchronous real-time narrative co-authoring)
  - Hybrid Federation (adaptive based on network latency and load)

api_endpoints:
  - /federation_initiate_narrative_task
  - /federation_get_node_status
  - /federation_aggregate_outputs
  - /federation_failover_reassign_task

synchronization_strategies:
  - Periodic narrative state syncing
  - Event-triggered narrative flushes
  - Consensus voting for cross-node narrative disputes

security:
  - Node authentication for federation participation
  - Rate-limiting for cross-node messaging
  - Content integrity verification

future_extensions:
  - AI-driven cross-node narrative style harmonization
  - Federation-wide narrative performance scoring
  - Cross-node multilingual narrative chaining
