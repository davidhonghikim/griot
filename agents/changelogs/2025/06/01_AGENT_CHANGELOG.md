- **[2025-06-28T04:15:00Z]**: SUCCESS - Phase 3 complete: griot-kitchen successfully integrated with service-connectors package. All endpoints tested and working:
  - Server running on port 8080 with automatic service registration
  - Service management API endpoints functional (/services, /services/:id, POST /services, etc.)
  - Protocol fallback logic working (HTTPS-first with HTTP fallback for local services)
  - Service connection testing and status monitoring operational
  - 4 service instances registered (ollama, comfyui, qdrant, openai) with proper error handling
  - All 21 service types available for registration across 5 categories

### SESSION SUMMARY:
**Accomplishments**: 
- Completed the service connector framework replacement mission by discovering and enhancing an existing comprehensive system
- Fixed critical TypeScript build errors in the service-connectors package
- Implemented smart protocol fallback logic (HTTPS-first with HTTP fallback for local services)
- Created a robust connection manager with caching and connection testing
- Successfully integrated service-connectors with griot-kitchen orchestrator
- Built and tested a complete REST API for service management with 21 available service types
- Verified all endpoints work correctly with proper error handling

**Final State**: The service connector framework is now production-ready with a complete integration between service-connectors package and griot-kitchen orchestrator. The system can handle both cloud and local service deployments with intelligent protocol fallback, and provides a comprehensive REST API for service management.

**Key Findings**: 
- The service connector framework was much more advanced than initially indicated in the handoff - it already had 21 connectors across 5 categories
- Previous agents had left incomplete type definitions and missing exports that caused build failures
- The protocol fallback logic was essential for real-world usage where local services often run HTTP-only
- Integration with griot-kitchen required careful handling of missing dependencies and type mismatches

## Agent: Gemini - 2025-06-28

**Mission**: Begin the Genesis Initiative by executing Phase 1: Foundational Database & API Setup.

### Log:
- **2025-06-28T18:00:00Z**: ONBOARDING - Session started. Reviewing rules, handoff directive, and project state.

- **2025-06-28T18:15:00Z**: CORRECTION - Removed incorrect database connection files from `src/core/db` and redirected to proper `packages/service-connectors` approach.
- **2025-06-28T18:20:00Z**: ACTION - Created service definitions for PostgreSQL, Weaviate, and Neo4j in `packages/service-connectors/src/storage/`.
- **2025-06-28T18:25:00Z**: ACTION - Created new `@griot/schemas` package with Mongoose schemas for `Skill` and `Persona` models.
- **2025-06-28T18:30:00Z**: ACTION - Created `src/server.ts` entry point for the Griot Node application.
- **2025-06-28T18:35:00Z**: ANALYSIS - User identified fundamental architectural issues. Project structure was confused between framework and application concerns.
- **2025-06-28T18:40:00Z**: REFACTORING - Executed major architectural overhaul:
  * Created `@griot/core` package and moved framework DNA from `griot-node/src`
  * Moved `griot-node/src` to `apps/starseed-node/src` (the primary application)
  * Moved `agents/skills` and `agents/personas` to `packages/data/` (centralized seed data)
  * Renamed `docs/` to `knowledge/` (reflecting its role as system intelligence)
  * Cleaned up empty root directories
  * Moved `packages/griot-kitchen` to `apps/griot-kitchen` (application, not library)
- **2025-06-28T19:00:00Z**: ANALYSIS - Conducted comprehensive review of both applications:
  * **Starseed Node**: Clean architecture using `@griot/core` but minimal functionality
  * **Griot Kitchen**: Functional service orchestration but legacy architecture and broken dependencies
  * **Integration Plan**: Merge Kitchen's proven functionality into Starseed's clean architecture
- **2025-06-28T19:05:00Z**: PLANNING - Documenting integration strategy for full KLF/kOS ecosystem compatibility
- **2025-06-28T19:10:00Z**: INTEGRATION - Created comprehensive service orchestration system:
  * Built modern ServiceManager using @griot/service-connectors
  * Created DatabaseManager with environment variable configuration
  * Updated server with full API endpoints for service management
  * Added HTTPS primary/HTTP fallback protocol configuration
  * Implemented comprehensive environment variable system
- **2025-06-28T19:15:00Z**: DOCUMENTATION - Created READMEs for both applications:

- **2025-06-28T19:20:00Z**: CONFIGURATION - Implemented environment variable system:
  * Service-specific hosts and ports (OLLAMA_HOST, COMFYUI_PORT, etc.)
  * Database connection configuration (MONGODB_URI, POSTGRES_HOST, etc.)
  * Service management settings (SERVICE_TEST_INTERVAL, CONNECTION_TIMEOUT)
  * Protocol configuration (HTTPS primary, HTTP fallback)
