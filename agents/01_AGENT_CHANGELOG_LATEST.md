# kOS Agent Changelog – Current Quarter (2025-Q2)

> NOTE: This file logs significant activity for the current **UTC** quarter in newest-first order.
> Older history is still available in `agents/01_AGENT_CHANGELOG.md` until full migration is complete.

## 2025-01-28T21:45:00Z – Claude-Sonnet-4 (MISSION: Continue systematic modular breakdown - Frontend Architecture and Mind Implementation Kit priority targets)
* CHANGE: ONBOARDING - Session started. Reviewed system prompt, workflow, architecture framework, and handoff directive. Logging script failed due to ES module error - proceeding with manual logging.
* FINDING: Priority targets already completed by previous session - Frontend Architecture (178 lines) and Mind Implementation Kit (265 lines) both successfully modularized with 4 modules each following Amauta gold standard pattern.
* CHANGE: Completed Hakim Architecture modular breakdown (844 lines → 4 focused modules) - Created Diagnostic Engine, Repair & Maintenance System, Health Monitoring & Alerting, and Lifecycle Management modules following Amauta gold standard pattern.
* CHANGE: Transformed main Hakim Architecture file from monolithic implementation to clean modular overview with proper cross-references, HIEROS integration, and implementation guidelines following established pattern.

### SESSION SUMMARY:
**Accomplishments**: 
- Successfully completed Hakim Architecture modular breakdown (844 lines → clean modular overview + 4 focused modules)
- Created comprehensive diagnostic engine module with predictive health analytics
- Developed autonomous repair and maintenance system module with cultural compliance
- Implemented intelligent health monitoring and alerting module with real-time capabilities
- Built lifecycle management module with provisioning, migration, and decommissioning features
- Transformed main architecture file to follow Amauta gold standard pattern
**Final State**: Hakim node now has consistent modular structure matching Amauta gold standard with 4 comprehensive modules and clean architectural overview. All modules include HIEROS compliance and cultural validation.
**Key Findings**: 
- Priority targets from handoff were already completed by previous session
- Largest node architecture files (Hakim 844 lines) are excellent candidates for modular breakdown
- Amauta gold standard pattern successfully scales to complex node architectures
- Systematic modular breakdown significantly improves maintainability and consistency

## 2025-06-27T22:57:39Z – Claude-Sonnet-4 (MISSION: Continue systematic modular breakdown using Amauta gold standard)
* CHANGE: Bootstrap session started - continuing systematic modular breakdown work following Amauta pattern for consistent quality across all kOS components.
* CHANGE: Created first Mind Implementation Kit module (01_Deployment_Installation.md) - comprehensive deployment automation system with health checks, configuration management, and operational procedures following Amauta gold standard pattern.
