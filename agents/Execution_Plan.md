# Execution Plan: Project Context Review

**Objective:** To gain a comprehensive understanding of the Griot Node project's vision, architecture, status, and immediate priorities by reviewing the core documentation.

**Date:** 2024-07-23

**Agent:** Gemini 2.5 Pro

---

## Phase 1: Initial Documentation Review

This phase follows the recommended reading order from `griot-node/agents/handoff.md` to build foundational knowledge.

### Steps:

1.  **[COMPLETED]** **Create Execution Plan:** Establish this document in `agents/Execution_Plan.md` to track all actions, as per project rules.

2.  **[COMPLETED]** **Review System Overview:**
    *   **Action:** Read `griot-node/ai-q/00_Index.md`.
    *   **Purpose:** To get a high-level overview of the entire kOS documentation system.
    *   **Finding:** The index is well-structured but points to a directory structure (`03_implementation`, `04_components`) that does not currently exist. The real specifications are in `ai-q/03_node_specifications`.

3.  **[COMPLETED]** **Understand Core Vision:**
    *   **Action:** Read `griot-node/ai-q/01_foundation/00_kOS_Vision.md`.
    *   **Purpose:** To internalize the project's philosophical and ethical foundations (kOS, HIEROS Codex).
    *   **Finding:** The vision is profound, framing the project as creating an "engine for emergent life." It defines the Griot node as the foundational "starseed."

4.  **[COMPLETED]** **Analyze Project Status:**
    *   **Action:** Reviewed `griot-node/agents/handoff.md` and `griot-node/agents/handoffs/01_Honest_Project_Status.md`.
    *   **Purpose:** To get a realistic assessment of the implementation gap.
    *   **Finding:** The handoffs confirm a major gap between vision and reality. They also contained conflicting information about the Griot Node Spec's completeness.

5.  **[COMPLETED]** **Investigate Reference Implementation:**
    *   **Action:** Listed contents of `archives/` and `archives/app_archive/`.
    *   **Purpose:** To understand the state of the archived backend and frontend code.
    *   **Finding:** A `server` (FastAPI) and `web-app` (React) implementation exists in the `app_archive` directory, confirming it's available for restoration.

6.  **[COMPLETED]** **Assess Node Specifications:**
    *   **Action:** Read `griot-node/ai-q/03_node_specifications/01_Griot_Node_Spec.md`.
    *   **Purpose:** To resolve conflicting reports and verify the state of the Griot spec.
    *   **Finding:** The Griot spec is critically underdeveloped at only 94 lines, confirming the statements in the primary `handoff.md`. This is the most urgent issue.

7.  **[ ] Synthesize and Report:**
    *   **Action:** Create a new execution plan for expanding the Griot Node specification.
    *   **Purpose:** To define the immediate development path to address the core architectural flaw.

## Phase 2: Foundation Repair - Griot Node Specification

**Objective:** To expand the Griot Node specification from a 94-line stub to a comprehensive, implementation-ready document of 700+ lines, consistent with other high-quality node specs in the project.

**Status: [COMPLETED]**

### Steps:

1.  **[ ] Create Detailed Sub-Plan:** Create a new markdown file `agents/Griot_Spec_Expansion_Plan.md` to outline the specific sections to be added (e.g., API endpoints, data models, cultural deep-dive, HIEROS implementation details).
2.  **[ ] Draft Expanded Specification:** Iteratively write the new sections for the Griot spec.
3.  **[ ] Review and Refine:** Ensure the expanded spec is consistent with the `kOS_Vision.md` and the existing `Tohunga_Node_Spec.md` as a quality benchmark.

---

## Phase 3: Node Specification Review & Alignment

**Objective:** To review all substantial node specifications and ensure they align with the canonical `01_Architecture_Principles.md`. This involves checking for consistency, identifying gaps, and recommending improvements.

### Steps:

1.  **[ ] List Node Specifications:** Identify all non-stub node spec files in `ai-q/03_node_specifications/`.
2.  **[ ] Review Tohunga Node:** Read `03_Tohunga_Node_Spec.md` as the primary quality benchmark alongside the Griot spec.
3.  **[ ] Review Ronin Node:** Read and analyze `04_Ronin_Node_Spec.md`.
4.  **[ ] Review Musa Node:** Read and analyze `05_Musa_Node_Spec.md`.
5.  **[ ] Review Hakim Node:** Read and analyze `06_Hakim_Node_Spec.md`.
6.  **[ ] Review Skald Node:** Read and analyze `07_Skald_Node_Spec.md`.
7.  **[ ] Review Oracle Node:** Read and analyze `08_Oracle_Node_Spec.md`.
8.  **[ ] Review Junzi Node:** Read and analyze `09_Junzi_Node_Spec.md`.
9.  **[ ] Generate Consolidated Report:** Create a new document, `agents/Node_Spec_Review.md`, with a summary of findings and recommendations for each node.

## Phase 4: Abstraction Refinement & Philosophical Realignment

**Objective:** To perform a second pass on all specifications to make them more abstract, primitive-based, and to realign the HIEROS Covenant implementation away from enforcement and towards providing tools for governance.

### Steps:

1.  **[ ] Globally Remove "Permission Status":** Edit all reviewed node specs to remove the line: `- **Permission Status**: Placeholder for future community consultation.`
2.  **[ ] Refactor Ronin Node API:** Abstract the API from specific commands (e.g., `/discover/scan`) to a generic, job-based model (e.g., `POST /jobs/discovery`).
3.  **[ ] Refactor Musa Node API:** Abstract the API from application-specific functions (e.g., `/auth/cultural-identity`) to generic security primitives (e.g., `POST /validate/credential`).
4.  **[ ] Review and Refine Tohunga Node:** Read and refactor the `Tohunga_Node_Spec.md` to ensure it aligns with the framework-first principle, abstracting its API and HIEROS implementation.
5.  **[ ] Re-align HIEROS Implementation:** In all substantial node specifications, review and rewrite the "HIEROS Covenant Compliance" sections. The focus will be to change language from *enforcing* subjective ethics (e.g., "Anti-Bias Security") to *providing auditable tools* for governance (e.g., "Provides tools to audit algorithms for statistical bias").
6.  **[ ] Final Review & Consolidation:** Perform a final check on all edited specifications to ensure consistency and create a summary report of the changes.

---

## Phase 5: Canonical Document Alignment

**Objective:** To ensure the project's highest-level philosophical and architectural documents are explicitly aligned with the core principle of being a neutral framework that maximizes freedom and creativity.

### Steps:

1.  **[ ] Review and Align `01_Architecture_Principles.md`:** This is the most critical document. I will rewrite the principles to explicitly state that the kOS is a neutral framework, providing tools for governance and security, but never enforcing subjective morality. The focus is on enabling choice and connection.
2.  **[ ] Review and Align `00_kOS_Vision.md`:** I will review the core vision document and adjust any language that implies the system itself will enforce ethical outcomes, shifting the focus to enabling users to make their own choices.
3.  **[ ] Review and Align `handoff.md`:** I will update the primary handoff document to ensure that this core philosophy‚Äî"Hope for the best, plan for the worst; enable freedom and creativity"‚Äîis a primary directive for all future development.
4.  **[ ] Final System-Wide Check:** Perform a final check to ensure philosophical consistency across all major documents.
