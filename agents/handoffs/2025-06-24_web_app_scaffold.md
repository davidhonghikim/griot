# Web App Scaffold Handoff

## What Was Done
1. Created `web-app/` via Vite React-TS template.
2. Added Tailwind, React Router, TanStack Query.
3. Implemented auth hook and login flow using local SDK.
4. Built Dashboard and Services pages (basic CRUD).
5. Linked local SDK via `npm install ../sdk` after adding `sdk/package.json`.

## Verification
- [x] `npm run dev` starts at http://localhost:5173 and shows login.
- [x] Successful login reaches dashboard and lists node identity.
- [x] Service CRUD operations work against local backend.

## Next Steps
1. Style polish with shadcn/ui.
2. Jobs page implementation.
3. Playwright E2E tests.
