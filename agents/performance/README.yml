quality_standards:
  title: "Quality Standards"
  description: "The system tracks quality across three dimensions:"
  dimensions:
    - "Code Quality: Clean, well-documented, follows best practices"
    - "Documentation Quality: Comprehensive, clear, actionable"
    - "Handoff Quality: Complete context, clear next steps"
  scale: "Each dimension uses a 4-point scale: poor, fair, good, excellent."

note: "This system is mandatory for all agent sessions and provides data-driven insights for continuous improvement."

archive_policy:
  title: "Archive Policy"
  note: "All performance archives are stored in agents/performance/archive/, organized by year and month. Do not use the centralized agents/archive/ directory for performance archives."
