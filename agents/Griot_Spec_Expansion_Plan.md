# Griot Spec Expansion Plan

**Objective:** To expand the Griot Node specification from a 94-line stub to a comprehensive, implementation-ready document of 700+ lines.

**Quality Benchmark:** `griot-node/ai-q/03_node_specifications/03_Tohunga_Node_Spec.md`

## Content Expansion Checklist

The following sections will be added to `01_Griot_Node_Spec.md` to bring it to standard.

### 1. **Conceptual & Cultural Deepening**
-   [ ] **Expand Overview:** Detail the Griot's role as the "Primal Starseed" and "Zygote" of the system.
-   [ ] **Add Cultural Deep-Dive:** Write a dedicated section on the West African Griot tradition and how it informs the node's function (e.g., preservation of oral history, community role, non-linear storytelling). This is critical for cultural sensitivity.
-   [ ] **HIEROS Codex Implementation:** Detail *how* each of the 7 HIEROS articles specifically manifests in the Griot's functions (e.g., how `stewardship_not_extraction` applies to package management).

### 2. **Technical & API Specification**
-   [ ] **Define Core Services:** Formally define the key services mentioned in the stub:
    -   `ReplicationService` (Package Management)
    -   `DifferentiationService` (Installation)
    -   `HomeostasisService` (Health & Repair)
-   [ ] **Define Data Models:** Specify the data structures for:
    -   `NodePackage` (The "spore" containing another node's code)
    -   `InstallationJob`
    -   `HealthReport`
-   [ ] **Define REST API Endpoints:** Add a complete OpenAPI/Swagger-style specification for the Griot's API.
    -   `POST /replicate`: Request to package a node spec into a deployable artifact.
    -   `GET /replicate/{packageId}`: Download a node package.
    -   `POST /differentiate`: Start a new installation job.
    -   `GET /differentiate/jobs/{jobId}`: Check installation status.
    -   `GET /health`: Node health check.
-   [ ] **Add Python Code Examples:** Provide `fastapi` and `httpx` examples for each API endpoint.

### 3. **Deployment & Configuration**
-   [ ] **Add Configuration Section:** Detail all environment variables and configuration file settings.
-   [ ] **Add Docker Deployment Guide:** Provide a sample `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` snippet for running a standalone Griot node.
-   [ ] **Add Monitoring & Observability:** Specify key metrics to be exposed (e.g., packages created, installations started, errors).

### 4. **Review and Finalize**
-   [ ] **Self-Correction and Review:** Once the draft is complete, review it against the Tohunga spec to ensure consistency in tone, structure, and level of detail.
-   [ ] **Final Polish:** Check for typos, formatting errors, and clarity. Update the document's frontmatter (`last_updated`, `version`).
