## 1. Current Project Status

**ALPHA 1.14** - Vault Web Server Deployment Complete

The PersonaRAG Bridge extension is now fully operational with a comprehensive web interface. The vault web server is running on port 3001 with full CRUD operations, service status monitoring, and API testing capabilities. All Docker services are running, and the extension popup works without OpenAI API errors.

**Key Achievements**:
- ✅ Vault web server deployed and operational on port 3001
- ✅ Web interface with React, Tailwind CSS, and comprehensive UI
- ✅ Service status monitoring and health checks
- ✅ Full vault management with CRUD operations
- ✅ API testing interface for all services
- ✅ Service configuration panel
- ✅ Browser-safe service initializer (no OpenAI API browser errors)
- ✅ All Docker services running (Weaviate, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Neo4j)

**Development Notes**:
- Web interface uses development CDN resources (React, Tailwind, Babel)
- Production optimization needed for CDN resources
- Vault server requires separate TypeScript compilation
