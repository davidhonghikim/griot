# **NEXT AGENT HANDOFF**

**UTC**: 2025-06-28
**From Agent**: Gemini
**Previous Handoff**: `agents/handoff/archive/2025-06-28_Gemini_Repo-Refactor-And-Genesis-Plan.md`

---

## 1. Current Project Status

The repository has undergone a complete, foundational refactoring. The structure is now a professional-grade monorepo with clear separation of concerns (`apps/`, `packages/`, `docs/`, `agents/`). The agent configuration system has been upgraded from static markdown files to a dynamic, compositional "Skills & Personas" model using YAML. A new master implementation plan, the **Genesis Initiative**, has been created to guide our next steps, and all our work has been committed to version control.

## 2. Your Directive

**Begin the Genesis Initiative.**

Your mission is to execute **Phase 1: Foundational Database & API Setup** of the Genesis plan. The immediate goal is to establish the core database infrastructure required for the Persona Forge.

**First Task**:
-   **Task 1.1**: Set up MongoDB, Weaviate, and Neo4j infrastructure.
-   **Context**: The full plan is located at `agents/implementation-plans/backlog/2025-06-28_genesis-initiative-/plan.md`.
-   **Recommendation**: The ideal approach is to create a `docker-compose.yml` file at the project root to define and manage these services for local development.

## 3. Context & History

For a complete history of the actions that led to this handoff, please review the Git commit titled **"feat(arch): Overhaul repository structure for scalability"**. The commit message provides a detailed summary of the new architecture. All previous implementation plans have been superseded by the Genesis Initiative plan, which is now the single source of truth for our path forward.
