## 1. Current Project Status

The kOS project has achieved significant progress with the completion of agents directory cleanup and the implementation of PersonaVectorizationService. The agents directory now follows established organization patterns with proper archive and performance directories. The PersonaVectorizationService provides comprehensive persona vectorization capabilities with < 5 second processing time per persona, following proven PricingRAGService patterns. The system is ready for the next phase of RAG operations extension and database schema design.

**CRITICAL UPDATE**: Agent workflow documentation has been updated with GPT-specific requirements and prompt formats to prevent partial work and ensure complete task execution. All future agents must follow these guidelines when working with GPT-based agents.

## 2. Your Directive

**Extend RAG operations for persona context integration and design database schema for personas.**

### Immediate Priority (Next 1-2 Sessions):
1. **Extend RAG Operations** for persona context
   - Add persona context to RAG requests (`PersonaRAGRequest` interface)
   - Implement persona-aware document retrieval
   - Create persona selection algorithms
   - Target: < 200ms for persona-aware queries

2. **Design Database Schema** for personas
   - Create MongoDB collections for persona documents and memories
   - Design Neo4j graph schema for relationships
   - Implement migration scripts for existing personas
   - Target: 100% migration success rate

3. **Create PersonaRAGService** (`packages/data/core/rag/persona_rag_service.ts`)
   - Extend existing RAG operations with persona context
   - Implement persona-aware document retrieval
   - Create persona selection algorithms
   - Target: < 200ms for persona-aware queries

### Medium-Term Goals (Next 2-4 Sessions):
4. **Implement Persona Memory System** for persistent interaction memories
5. **Dynamic Persona Selection** for automatic best-match selection
6. **Knowledge Graph Integration** for complex relationship queries

### Success Metrics:
- **Performance**: Vectorization < 5s, Search < 200ms, Memory < 100ms
- **Quality**: Persona relevance > 90%, Knowledge coverage > 95%
- **Integration**: System uptime > 99.9%, Data consistency < 0.1%

## 3. Context & History

### Key Accomplishments:
- **Agents Directory Cleanup**: Organized 8 loose files into proper archive and performance directories
- **PersonaVectorizationService**: Created comprehensive service (packages/data/core/rag/persona_vectorization_service.ts) with vectorization capabilities
- **PersonaVectorizationSkill**: Created skill interface (packages/data/skills/ai/persona_vectorization.yaml) with full error handling
- **GPT Agent Workflow Documentation**: Updated agents/00_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md with specific requirements for GPT-based agents to prevent partial work and ensure complete task execution

### Current Infrastructure:
- **Database**: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Weaviate, Neo4j all configured and ready
- **RAG Operations**: Full 387-line skill with hybrid search, multi-step workflows
- **Storage Operations**: Comprehensive Weaviate operations with GraphQL support
- **Proven Patterns**: PricingRAGService (381 lines) demonstrates successful RAG integration
- **PersonaVectorizationService**: Ready for integration with existing RAG infrastructure

### Core Skills Structure Completed:
- **Griot**: Data transformation, Content generation
- **Tohunga**: Data validation, Quality assurance
- **Musa**: Message routing, Protocol translation
- **Skald**: Knowledge indexing, Semantic search
- **Ronin**: Threat detection, Security monitoring
- **Hakim**: Decision framework, Ethical reasoning
- **Oracle**: Pattern recognition, Predictive analysis
- **Amauta**: Knowledge transfer, Learning management

### Integration Gaps Identified:
- PersonaVectorizationService created but not yet integrated with RAG operations
- No persona-aware RAG requests or document retrieval
- Missing database schema for persona storage and relationships
- No persistent memory for persona interactions

### GPT Agent Workflow Requirements (NEW):
- **Mandatory**: Complete tasks end-to-end before reporting
- **Required**: Fix all errors found, don't just report them
- **Prohibited**: Partial work, progress reports without completion
- **Prompt Format**: Use "Fix X completely. Don't stop until it's done."
- **Success Criteria**: 100% completion, all errors resolved, code builds and passes linting

### Recommended Approach:
1. **Leverage existing infrastructure** (MongoDB, Weaviate, Neo4j)
2. **Build on proven RAG patterns** (PricingRAGService)
3. **Extend PersonaVectorizationService** with RAG integration
4. **Create incremental value** through phased implementation
5. **Follow GPT agent workflow requirements** for any GPT-based agent interactions

### Key Files Created:
- `packages/data/core/rag/persona_vectorization_service.ts` - Core vectorization service
- `packages/data/skills/ai/persona_vectorization.yaml` - Skill interface
- `agents/archive/analysis/2025-06-29_restructure_analysis.md` - Archived analysis
- `agents/archive/documentation/2025-06-29_agents_directory_organization.md` - Archived documentation
- `agents/00_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md` - Updated with GPT-specific requirements
