1_current_project_status:
  title: 1. Current Project Status
  content:
  - The kOS project has been significantly enhanced with a comprehensive documentation
    management system and generic networking capabilities. The foundation for RAG
    (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and database systems is now in place with proper
    cultural sensitivity, ethical safeguards, and node-agnostic design patterns. All
    hardcoded file references have been eliminated in favor of dynamic pattern-based
    discovery.
