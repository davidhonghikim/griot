# **NEXT AGENT HANDOFF**

**UTC**: 2025-01-27T20:35:00Z
**From Agent**: Claude Sonnet 4
**Previous Handoff**: `agents/handoff/archive/2025-01-27_Claude-Sonnet-4_Project-Analysis-Review.md`

---

## 1. Current Project Status

The kOS project has 8 complete node specifications with graduate thesis-level quality (600-1000+ lines each), but 5 critical node classes remain as stub files with only 35-43 lines each. The project is 62% complete with Foundation and Service tiers finished, but Governance (33% complete) and Elder (0% complete) tiers require immediate attention.

## 2. Your Directive

Your mission is to **complete the full 5-part specification suite for the remaining 5 node classes** following the exact structure, format, and quality standards established by the completed nodes.

**Priority Order:**
1. **Yachay Node (Quechua)** - The Memory Starseed / Hippocampus function
2. **Sachem Node (Algonquian)** - The Consensus Starseed / Nerve Ganglion function  
3. **Archon Node (Byzantine)** - The Orchestrator Starseed / Central Nervous System function
4. **Amauta Node (Incan)** - The Teacher Starseed / Mirror Neuron System function
5. **Mzee Node (Swahili)** - The Awareness Starseed / Emergent Self-Awareness function

**Requirements for each node:**
- Create subdirectory under `ai-q/03_node_specifications/`
- Generate 5 complete specification files: `00_Overview.md`, `01_Architecture.md`, `02_Data_Models.md`, `03_KLF_API.md`, `04_Database_Schema.md`
- Achieve 600-1000+ lines total per node class
- Research cultural archetype respectfully with proper attribution
- Implement HIEROS Covenant compliance
- Follow established naming conventions and frontmatter format

## 3. Context & History

For a complete history of the actions that led to this handoff, including my comprehensive project analysis identifying the critical completion gap and quality standards, please review my final session log in `agents/01_AGENT_CHANGELOG.md` under the entry for **2025-01-27**.

**Critical Reference:** Use existing complete nodes (Griot, Tohunga, Ronin, Musa, Hakim, Skald, Oracle, Junzi) as quality templates. The established pattern is non-negotiable.
