1_current_project_status:
  title: 1. Current Project Status
  content:
  - The kOS project now has a **FULLY FUNCTIONAL RAG implementation**! All critical
    fixes have been completed successfully. The system can now perform complete persona
    vectorization workflows from YAML file loading through vector storage and semantic
    search. All core services (PersonaLoader, VectorStore, EmbeddingService) are implemented
    with real functionality, MongoDB schema matches expectations, migration script
    is ready, and comprehensive integration tests are in place.
  - '**Key Achievements**:'
  items:
  - ✅ All core RAG services implemented with real functionality
  - ✅ PersonaLoader loads actual YAML files from filesystem
  - ✅ VectorStore connects to Weaviate with full CRUD operations
  - ✅ EmbeddingService uses OpenAI embeddings with batch processing
  - ✅ MongoDB schema updated to match PersonaVectorizationService expectations
  - ✅ Database migration script created with CLI interface
  - ✅ Comprehensive integration tests with Jest configuration
  - ✅ All dependencies added to package.json
