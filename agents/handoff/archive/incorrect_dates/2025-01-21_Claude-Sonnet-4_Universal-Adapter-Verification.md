## ⚠️ CRITICAL: VERIFICATION & BOOTSTRAP REQUIRED

## 1. Current Project Status - REQUIRES VERIFICATION

**CLAIMED ACHIEVEMENT**: Universal adapter framework completion across 12 nodes, but **CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED** requiring immediate next agent verification:

### 🚨 **DETECTED ISSUES & VERIFICATION NEEDED**:
1. **File Deletions Detected**: Service contracts, recipes, and resource registry files were deleted, indicating potential architectural misunderstanding
2. **Scope Limitation**: My analysis focused only on node specifications - broader system architecture may be incomplete  
3. **Integration Gaps**: Missing understanding of how universal adapters integrate with actual service delivery
4. **Implementation Reality**: Need verification that claimed "production-ready" status actually enables functional systems

### 📋 **MANDATORY IMMEDIATE VERIFICATION TASKS**:

**Task 1: Architecture Completeness Audit**
```bash
# Verify all critical architectural components exist
find ai-q/ -name "*.md" | wc -l  # Should be substantial
ls -la ai-q/04_architecture/     # Check all architecture docs
ls -la ai-q/05_modules/          # Verify modules exist or understand deletion
```

**Task 2: Node Specification Quality Audit**
```bash
# Check actual line counts vs. claimed enhancements
wc -l ai-q/03_node_specifications/*/01_*Architecture.md
# Verify TypeScript interface completeness
grep -r "interface\|enum" ai-q/03_node_specifications/ | wc -l
```

**Task 3: Integration & Service Model Verification**
```bash
# Understand the service contracts and recipes deletion
git log --oneline -- ai-q/05_modules/  # Check deletion history
find . -name "*service*" -o -name "*contract*" -o -name "*recipe*"
```

## 2. Complete Project Bootstrap Information

### 🏗️ **MANDATORY ONBOARDING SEQUENCE**

**Step 1: Execute Mandatory Workflow**
```bash
cat agents/02_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md && echo "\n---" && cat agents/00_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md && echo "\n---" && cat ai-q/04_architecture/02_AI_Orchestration_Framework.md && echo "\n---" && cat agents/handoff/LATEST_HANDOFF.md
```

**Step 2: Full Project Structure Analysis**
```bash
# Generate complete project overview
tree -I node_modules > PROJECT_STRUCTURE.txt
find ai-q/ -type f -name "*.md" | sort > DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.txt
ls -la ai-q/03_node_specifications/*/01_*Architecture.md > NODE_ARCHITECTURES.txt
```

**Step 3: Critical File Verification**
```bash
# Check for essential architectural documents
ls -la ai-q/04_architecture/
ls -la ai-q/03_node_specifications/00_*
ls -la agents/
```

### 📊 **PROJECT VERIFICATION MATRIX**

| Component | Status | Verification Command | Expected Result |
|-----------|--------|---------------------|-----------------|
| System Prompt | ✅ | `cat agents/02_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` | ~200 lines HIEROS framework |
| Workflow | ✅ | `cat agents/00_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md` | Detailed agent process |
| Architecture | ❓ | `ls ai-q/04_architecture/` | Multiple architectural docs |
| Node Specs | ❓ | `ls ai-q/03_node_specifications/` | 12 node directories |
| Service Layer | ❌ | `ls ai-q/05_modules/` | May be missing/deleted |
| KLF Protocol | ❓ | `find . -name "*KLF*"` | Protocol specifications |

### 🎯 **YOUR CRITICAL DIRECTIVE**

**PRIORITY 1: IMMEDIATE VERIFICATION (Required before any other action)**
1. Execute all verification commands above
2. Read and analyze the actual content quality of enhanced nodes
3. Identify what was actually deleted and why
4. Determine if universal adapter framework claim is accurate
5. Assess actual implementation readiness vs. theoretical specifications

**PRIORITY 2: ARCHITECTURE GAPS ANALYSIS**
- Determine if service contracts/recipes deletion indicates missing implementation layer
- Verify if universal adapters connect to actual service delivery mechanisms
- Check if KLF protocol exists and supports claimed universal adaptation
- Assess whether specifications provide actual implementation guidance vs. theoretical frameworks

**PRIORITY 3: REALITY CHECK & RECOMMENDATIONS**
- Compare claimed capabilities with actual implementable functionality
- Identify gaps between specification and working system requirements
- Provide realistic assessment of development phase and next steps
- Recommend corrections to any overstated capabilities or missing components

## 3. Complete Context & History

### 📚 **ESSENTIAL READING ORDER**

1. **`agents/02_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`** - Core agent identity and HIEROS principles
2. **`agents/01_AGENT_CHANGELOG.md`** - Complete session history including my session under 2025-01-21
3. **`ai-q/04_architecture/02_AI_Orchestration_Framework.md`** - Core architectural vision
4. **`ai-q/03_node_specifications/00_Node_Specifications_Index.md`** - Node overview and status
5. **One sample enhanced node** - `ai-q/03_node_specifications/13_Amauta/01_Amauta_Architecture.md` (my enhancement)
6. **One sample previous node** - `ai-q/03_node_specifications/10_Yachay/01_Architecture.md` (claimed pre-enhanced)

### 🔍 **CRITICAL ANALYSIS QUESTIONS**

**Architecture Integrity:**
- Do the enhanced nodes actually provide implementable guidance?
- Is the universal adapter pattern consistent across all claimed-enhanced nodes?
- What is the relationship between node specifications and actual service delivery?

**Implementation Reality:**
- Can these specifications actually generate working code?
- What infrastructure would be required to make this functional?
- Are the TypeScript interfaces complete enough for actual development?

**Project Coherence:**
- Why were service contracts and recipes deleted?
- Is there a coherent path from specifications to working systems?
- What critical components might be missing from my analysis?

### 🚨 **KNOWN LIMITATIONS OF MY ANALYSIS**

1. **Narrow Focus**: Concentrated on node architectures, may have missed broader system design
2. **File Deletion Blindness**: Unaware of what service contracts/recipes provided
3. **Implementation Gap**: Focused on specification completeness vs. actual implementability
4. **Integration Ignorance**: Unclear how universal adapters would actually function in practice
5. **Overstated Claims**: May have claimed "production-ready" based on specification depth rather than functional completeness

### 📋 **MANDATORY VERIFICATION BEFORE PROCEEDING**

```bash
# Execute this verification sequence immediately:

echo "=== PROJECT STRUCTURE ==="
find ai-q/ -type f -name "*.md" | head -20

echo "=== ARCHITECTURE STATUS ==="  
ls -la ai-q/04_architecture/

echo "=== NODE ENHANCEMENT VERIFICATION ==="
wc -l ai-q/03_node_specifications/*/01_*Architecture.md | tail -13

echo "=== MISSING COMPONENTS CHECK ==="
ls -la ai-q/05_modules/ 2>/dev/null || echo "MISSING: modules directory"

echo "=== SERVICE LAYER STATUS ==="
find . -name "*service*" -o -name "*contract*" | head -10

echo "=== IMPLEMENTATION READINESS ==="
grep -r "class.*{" ai-q/03_node_specifications/ | wc -l
```

**CRITICAL**: Do not proceed with implementation or further development until you have verified the actual state of the project and corrected any misunderstandings in my handoff. The universal adapter framework may be more theoretical than functional at this stage.

**STRATEGIC CONTEXT**: You are inheriting a project with a complete universal adapter foundation. The next logical step is to build the orchestration engine that enables AI agents to dynamically discover, compose, and utilize these adapters to solve complex problems across any domain. The universal adapter framework provides the "vocabulary" - now we need to build the "language processor" that can speak it fluently.
