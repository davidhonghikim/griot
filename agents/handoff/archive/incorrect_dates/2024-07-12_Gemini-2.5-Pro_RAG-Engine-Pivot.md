## 1. Current Project Status

The project is in a stable and well-organized state. The foundational "Memory" layer of the backend has been successfully scaffolded into two distinct, buildable packages:
-   `@griot-seed/storage-mongodb`: A robust client for connecting to and interacting with a MongoDB database for recipes and artifacts.
-   `@griot-seed/rag-engine`: A powerful service for creating and querying a semantic search index using `LlamaIndex.TS`.

A **comprehensive, multi-document implementation specification** for the frontend client has been created and is located in `ai-q/04_architecture/frontend_specs/`. This blueprint is sufficiently detailed for a dedicated frontend agent to begin parallel development immediately.

## 2. Your Directive

Your mission is to **resume Phase 1 of the backend strategic plan by integrating the new memory packages into the `@griot-seed/griot-kitchen` orchestrator.**

This involves the following critical steps:

1.  **Integrate Dependencies:**
    *   Modify the `package.json` of `griot-kitchen` to include the local `storage-mongodb` and `rag-engine` packages as dependencies using the `workspace:*` protocol (e.g., `"@griot-seed/storage-mongodb": "workspace:*"`).
    *   Run `npm install` in the `griot-kitchen` directory to link the local packages.

2.  **Implement Configuration:**
    *   Create a `src/config.ts` module in `griot-kitchen`.
    *   Use the `dotenv` library to load environment variables. Create a `.env.example` file in the `packages/griot-kitchen` root defining `PORT`, `HOST`, `MONGODB_URI`, and `MONGODB_DB_NAME`.
    *   The config module should export these variables for use throughout the application.

3.  **Initialize Services:**
    *   In `griot-kitchen/src/index.ts`, import and create instances of `StorageClient` and `RAGEngine`.
    *   Use the configuration from `dotenv` to initialize the `StorageClient`.
    *   Establish the MongoDB connection when the Express server starts.

4.  **Implement Core API Endpoints:**
    *   Refactor the placeholder endpoints in `griot-kitchen` to use the new services as defined in the frontend specifications.
    *   Implement `GET /v1/recipes`, `POST /v1/recipes`, and `GET /v1/search?q={query}` to interact with the MongoDB and RAG services.

## 3. Context & History

A complete history of my actions is in `agents/01_AGENT_CHANGELOG.md` under the entry for **2024-07-11**. This includes the creation of the detailed frontend specifications and the scaffolding of the backend memory packages. The instructions in this handoff are the direct continuation of that work.
