1_current_project_status:
  title: 1. Current Project Status
  content:
  - The project has successfully established standardized naming conventions and modular
    architecture for the `packages/service-connectors/adapters/documentation/` directory.
    TypeScript import errors have been resolved, and a comprehensive naming system
    has been implemented. The next phase requires applying these same standards across
    ALL remaining code directories to ensure consistency and maintainability throughout
    the entire codebase.

  title: 2. Your Directive
  content:
  - '**MISSION**: Apply the established standardized naming system and modular architecture
    patterns to ALL remaining code directories in the project. This includes packages,
    apps, scripts, and any other code directories that contain monolithic or inconsistently
    named modules.'
  - '**PRIMARY GOAL**: Achieve complete consistency across the entire codebase by
    implementing the standardized naming conventions, modular architecture, and documentation
    patterns established in the service-connectors package.'
