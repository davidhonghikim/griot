    kOS project with comprehensive foundation including RAG services, secure vault system, and database infrastructure. 
    PersonaRAG Bridge has critical TypeScript compilation errors (107 errors) preventing build completion. 
    API key configuration fixed but systematic error resolution required before system can be tested.

context_and_history:
  description: |
    Previous agent completed comprehensive project analysis and identified critical TypeScript compilation errors 
    in PersonaRAG Bridge. API key configuration was fixed but systematic error resolution is required before 
    system can be tested. Database infrastructure is fully operational.
  
  last_session_summary: |
    Completed comprehensive project analysis covering architecture, security, best practices, documentation format, 
    runtime logic, missing components, dependencies, and overall professionalism. Identified 107 TypeScript 
    compilation errors in PersonaRAG Bridge requiring systematic resolution. Fixed API key configuration issue 
    but build process needs completion. Established quality-over-speed approach for next development phase.
