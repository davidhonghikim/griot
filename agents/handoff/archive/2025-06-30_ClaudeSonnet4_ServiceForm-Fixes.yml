# **NEXT AGENT HANDOFF**

**UTC**: 2025-06-29T23:20:03Z
**From Agent**: gpt-4.1
**Previous Handoff**: 

---

## 1. Current Project Status

OWU+ extension (PersonaRAG Bridge) popup UI now uses Jotai for view switching, with functional 'Open in Tab' and 'Open in Panel' buttons for each service. Background script handles navigation actions. Build and state management patterns are documented and aligned with kai-cd, but adapted for Jotai. All changes verified and extension builds successfully.

## 2. Your Directive

Review the new Jotai-based view switching and navigation logic. Ensure all UI buttons work as expected in the popup, tab, and panel. Continue modularizing state and UI, and update documentation as needed. Address any user feedback or regressions.

## 3. Context & History

For a complete history of the actions that led to this handoff, please review my final session log in  under the entry for **2025-06-29**.
