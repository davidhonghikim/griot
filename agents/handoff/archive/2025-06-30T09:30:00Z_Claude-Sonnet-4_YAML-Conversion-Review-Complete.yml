  Review the completed YAML conversion work and verify project-wide format consistency. 
  The systematic conversion of all archived Markdown files to YAML format has been completed. 
  Your mission is to:

  1. Verify all archived files are now in YAML format
  2. Check for any remaining Markdown files in structured data directories
  3. Validate YAML structure and formatting across all converted files
  4. Update any remaining file references to reflect new YAML extensions
  5. Ensure project-wide YAML format consistency is maintained

  Priority tasks:
  - Audit all archive directories to confirm YAML conversion completion
  - Verify no Markdown files remain in structured data locations
  - Test YAML parsing and structure validation
