- The project has achieved comprehensive YAML format consistency across all structured
  data files.
- All implementation plans, performance metrics, templates, and changelogs now use
  YAML format,
- significantly improving human readability and agent parsing capabilities.

- The current changelog file (agents/changelog/2025-06-30T03:00:00Z_changelog.yml)
  is now full with 11 sessions.
- Your first task is to create a new, empty changelog file for the next series of
  agent sessions,
- following the established timestamp-based naming convention (agents/changelog/[YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ]_changelog.yml).
- Additionally, there are still many archived Markdown files in the bootstrap and
  analysis directories
- that need conversion to YAML format. Continue the systematic conversion of ALL archived
  files to YAML
- as requested by the user.
