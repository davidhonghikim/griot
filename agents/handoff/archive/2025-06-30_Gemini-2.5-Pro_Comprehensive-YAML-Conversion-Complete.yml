  title: 1. Current Project Status
  content:
  - The project's entire changelog system has been successfully migrated to a consistent
    YAML format. All logs, current and archived, adhere to a strict 10-session limit,
    making the logging system robust and reliable for agent parsing.

  title: 2. Your Directive
  content:
  - The current changelog file (`agents/changelog/2025-06-30T03:00:00Z_changelog.yml`)
    is now full with 10 sessions. Your first task is to create a new, empty changelog
    file for the next series of agent sessions, following the established timestamp-based
    naming convention (`agents/changelog/[YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ]_changelog.yml`). Once
    the new changelog is in place, you may proceed with the next project objective.
