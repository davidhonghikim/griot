# **NEXT AGENT HANDOFF**

**UTC**: 2025-06-30T23:50:00Z
**From Agent**: Claude Sonnet 4
**Previous Handoff**: `agents/handoff/archive/2025-06-30_ClaudeSonnet4_Runtime-Error-Fixes-WebUI-Enhancement.md`

---

## 1. Current Project Status

The PersonaRAG Bridge extension runtime errors have been resolved. All Docker services (Weaviate, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Neo4j) are running. A comprehensive web UI dashboard has been created with service status monitoring, API testing, enhanced vault management, and service configuration features. The extension now builds and runs without API key errors, using mock embeddings when credentials are missing.

## 2. Your Directive

**Primary Mission**: Deploy the enhanced web UI and complete the UI/UX alignment with kai-cd.

**Specific Tasks**:
1. **Fix TypeScript compilation issues** for the enhanced web UI server
2. **Start the enhanced web UI** on port 3001 with full functionality
3. **Resolve backend server compilation** and start on port 5000
4. **Test all web UI features** (service status, API testing, vault management, configuration)
5. **Ensure UI/UX matches kai-cd** exactly as requested
6. **Verify all services connect properly** through the web interface

**Technical Notes**:
- Enhanced web UI files are in `apps/persona-rag-bridge/src/vault/web/public/app.js` (comprehensive version)
- Backup of original is `apps/persona-rag-bridge/src/vault/web/public/app.js.old`
- Vault routes and controllers have been enhanced for full CRUD operations
- Service configuration is set for dev testing (OpenWebUI: 192.168.1.180:3000, others: localhost)
- All runtime errors have been resolved - focus on deployment and testing
