current_project_status: |
  The project has achieved significant progress in YAML format consistency across archived documentation. 
  Six major archived files totaling approximately 1,500+ lines have been successfully converted to YAML format 
  while maintaining complete data integrity. A new changelog file has been created as the previous one was full 
  with 11 sessions. The systematic conversion of archived Markdown files to YAML format has been demonstrated 
  with comprehensive project documentation.

  Continue the systematic conversion of remaining archived Markdown files to YAML format. 
  There are still 5 archived Markdown files in agents/bootstrap/archive/2025/06/ and 3 archived 
  Markdown files in agents/analysis/archive/2025/06/ that need conversion to YAML format.

  Priority order:
  1. Complete conversion of remaining archived Markdown files to YAML format
  2. Verify all structured data files are in YAML format
  3. Update any remaining file references to reflect new YAML extensions
  4. Ensure no JSON or Markdown files remain in structured data directories

  Files remaining for conversion:
  Bootstrap archive: system_prompt_optimization_backup.md, directory_analysis_and_corrections.md, 
  directory_structure_audit_summary.md, agent_workflow.md, project_overview.md, system_prompt.md
  Analysis archive: agent_leftover_work.md, bootstrap_guide.md, history_system.md
