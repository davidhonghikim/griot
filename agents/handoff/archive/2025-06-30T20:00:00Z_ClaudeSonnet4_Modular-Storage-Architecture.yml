context_and_history:
  description: |
    Previous agent completed comprehensive project verification and implemented modular storage architecture.
    Replaced monolithic storage approach with focused, modular components following project rules.
    All TypeScript errors resolved, build system fully functional, storage systems ready for testing.
  
  last_session_summary: |
    Implemented modular storage architecture with IndexedDB, MongoDB, and RAG integration. Created focused,
    single-purpose modules: IndexedDBManager, MongoDBManager, RAGManager, and StorageCoordinator. Fixed
    all TypeScript errors and achieved successful build. Extension ready for testing with comprehensive
    3-tier storage system for chat messages, artefacts, and personas with semantic search capabilities.
