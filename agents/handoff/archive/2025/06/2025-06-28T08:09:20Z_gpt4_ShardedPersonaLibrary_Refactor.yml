1_current_project_status:
  title: 1. Current Project Status
  content:
  - The kOS project now has a complete persona-driven asset loading system that allows
    each persona to specify which asset types, categories, and tags to load by default.
    The system enforces file size limits for optimal token usage, includes comprehensive
    validation, and supports both new and legacy persona formats. All agents are now
    required to adhere to file size standards and use the code review checklist. The
    asset indexing system is fully functional with chunked JSON indexes and dynamic
    loading capabilities.
2_your_directive:
  title: 2. Your Directive
  content:
  - '**Implement and test the persona-driven asset loading system with real-world
    scenarios and performance optimization.**'
  items:
  - Test the PersonaLoader with various persona configurations and asset combinations
  - Optimize the asset filtering and loading algorithms for better performance
  - Implement caching strategies for frequently used personas and assets
  - Create additional example persona configurations for other node types (Tohunga,
    Ronin, etc.)
  - Add integration tests to ensure the system works correctly with the agent bootstrap
    process
  - Monitor and optimize memory usage and context window efficiency
  - (Optional) Implement dynamic persona switching during runtime
  - (Optional) Add persona composition capabilities for complex multi-persona scenarios
