1_executive_summary__mission:
  title: 1. Executive Summary & Mission
  content:
  - '**Project State**: The service connector framework replacement mission has revealed
    that a comprehensive system already exists with 21 connectors across 5 categories.
    The framework implements the "universal adapter" pattern from kai-cd but requires
    completion of proper protocol handling and build fixes.'
  - '**Critical Discovery**: The framework is much more advanced than the original
    handoff indicated. Rather than needing to be built from scratch, it needs protocol
    fallback logic, type system completion, and final build verification.'
  - '**Your Directive**: Complete the service connector framework by implementing
    **smart protocol fallback logic** (HTTPS-first with HTTP fallback for local services),
    fix remaining build issues, and verify the complete system works properly with
    the griot-kitchen orchestrator.'

      include required `query`, `upsert`, `delete` endpoints to match VectorDatabaseCapability
      interface.'
    - '**Fix ComfyUI Parameter Mapping**: The ComfyUI connector uses advanced parameter
      mapping for graph-based workflows. Ensure the type system properly supports
      this pattern.'
    - '**Complete Authentication Types**: Add support for `defaultValue` in AuthDefinition
      for services like LM Studio and vLLM.'

  title: 5. Critical Technical Details
  content: []
  51_universal_adapter_pattern:
    title: 5.1. Universal Adapter Pattern
    content:
    - 'The framework implements a sophisticated universal adapter pattern where:'
    items:
    - Each service is defined declaratively through ServiceDefinition
    - Capabilities are modular (LLM, ImageGen, VectorDB, etc.)
    - Parameters are self-describing with validation rules
    - Complex services like ComfyUI use parameter mapping for graph workflows
  52_protocol_handling_strategy:
    title: 5.2. Protocol Handling Strategy
    content:
    - '**Current Implementation**:'
    - 'protocol: ''https'' | ''http''  // Static per service'
    - '**Required Enhancement**:'
    - 'protocol: {'
    - 'primary: ''https'' | ''http'','
    - 'fallback?: ''https'' | ''http'','
    - 'autoDetect?: boolean'
    - '}'
  53_key_architecture_files:
    title: 5.3. Key Architecture Files
    content:
    - '---'
    items:
    - '`types.ts`: Core interfaces and type definitions'
    - '`all.ts`: Service registry with category organization'
    - '`ai-models/`: 10 AI service connectors'
    - '`storage/`: 5 storage service connectors (including vector DBs)'
    - '`image-generation/`: 2 image generation service connectors'
6_success_criteria:
  title: 6. Success Criteria
  content:
  - '**Phase 1 Complete**: `npm run build` succeeds with zero TypeScript errors'
  - '**Phase 2 Complete**: Protocol fallback logic implemented and tested'
  - '**Phase 3 Complete**: Integration with griot-kitchen verified, all connectors
    functional'
  - '**Final Deliverable**: A robust, production-ready service connector framework
    that can adapt to any service through declarative definitions with smart protocol
    handling for both cloud and local deployments.'
  - '---'
7_context__constraints:
  title: 7. Context & Constraints
  content:
  - '**Time Constraint**: Context window is full - prioritize getting the build working
    first, then implement the protocol fallback logic.'
  - '**Quality Emphasis**: User emphasized "do it right" - focus on proper implementation
    over quick compilation fixes.'
  - '**Local Service Priority**: Many users will run local services (Ollama, ComfyUI,
    etc.) that don''t support HTTPS. The fallback mechanism is essential for real-world
    usage.'
  - This framework will be the foundation for the entire kOS orchestration system
    - it must be robust, flexible, and handle real-world deployment scenarios properly.
