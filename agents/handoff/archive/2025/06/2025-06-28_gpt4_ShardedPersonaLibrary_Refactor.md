## 1. Current Project Status

The kOS project now has a complete persona-driven asset loading system that allows each persona to specify which asset types, categories, and tags to load by default. The system enforces file size limits for optimal token usage, includes comprehensive validation, and supports both new and legacy persona formats. All agents are now required to adhere to file size standards and use the code review checklist. The asset indexing system is fully functional with chunked JSON indexes and dynamic loading capabilities.

## 2. Your Directive

**Implement and test the persona-driven asset loading system with real-world scenarios and performance optimization.**

- Test the PersonaLoader with various persona configurations and asset combinations
- Optimize the asset filtering and loading algorithms for better performance
- Implement caching strategies for frequently used personas and assets
- Create additional example persona configurations for other node types (Tohunga, Ronin, etc.)
- Add integration tests to ensure the system works correctly with the agent bootstrap process
- Monitor and optimize memory usage and context window efficiency
- (Optional) Implement dynamic persona switching during runtime
- (Optional) Add persona composition capabilities for complex multi-persona scenarios

## 3. Context & History

- File size and modularization standards are established and enforced
- Example persona configurations exist for griot-v1 and musa personas
- Comprehensive documentation is available for the system
- Asset indexing system supports all asset types with chunked JSON indexes
