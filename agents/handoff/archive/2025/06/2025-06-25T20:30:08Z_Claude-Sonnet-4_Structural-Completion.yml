1_current_project_status:
  title: 1. Current Project Status
  content:
  - The kOS project has complete directory structures for all 12 node specifications,
    but ALL nodes are below the comprehensive coverage standard required for a definitive
    knowledge library. Even the 10 "complete" nodes (ranging from 353-479 lines) lack
    the depth and granularity needed, falling 100-200+ lines short of the 600-1000+
    comprehensive standard.
2_your_directive:
  title: 2. Your Directive
  content:
  - Your mission is to **expand all existing node specifications to achieve true comprehensive
    coverage** as the definitive knowledge library and source of truth for the kOS
    ecosystem.
  - '**Priority Focus Areas:**'
  - '**Completion Targets:**'
  - '**Quality Standard**: Each node must serve as a comprehensive, granular, low-level
    detailed specification that prevents agents from making assumptions or inventing
    details. Everything must be documented as the source of truth.'
  items:
  - '**Technical Depth**: Add detailed implementation guidance, edge cases, and error
    handling specifications'
  - '**KLF API Expansion**: Create comprehensive examples and usage patterns for all
    message types'
  - '**Database Schema Optimization**: Include performance considerations, indexing
    strategies, and scaling patterns'
  - '**Architecture Details**: Expand component interactions, data flows, and system
    integration patterns'
  - '**All 10 existing nodes**: Expand from current 350-480 lines to 600-1000+ lines'
  - '**Amauta Node**: Complete missing 3 specification files and expand to full coverage'
  - '**Mzee Node**: Create complete directory structure and full 5-part specification
    suite'
3_context__history:
  title: 3. Context & History
  content:
  - For a complete history of the actions that led to this handoff, including my comprehensive
    analysis revealing that all nodes require significant expansion beyond structural
    completion, please review my final session log in `agents/01_AGENT_CHANGELOG.md`
    under the entry for **2025-01-27**.
  - '**Critical Insight**: Previous agents focused on structural completion rather
    than comprehensive depth. The foundation exists but requires substantial expansion
    to achieve the knowledge library standard.'
