  title: "Current Project Status"
  description: "The kOS project has achieved significant progress in systematic modular breakdown with proven methodology. Amauta gold standard pattern successfully applied to multiple architectures. Priority modular breakdown work is approximately 40% complete with consistent quality standards established across all completed modules."

  critical_assumptions:
    title: "CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT MY SESSION"
    assumptions:
      - "I may have left incomplete work: Double-check all files I modified for consistency"
      - "Potential errors in implementation: Review my module breakdowns for quality issues"
      - "Missing cross-references: Verify all main architecture files properly reference their modules"
      - "Incomplete HIEROS compliance: Check cultural sensitivity and validation in all modules"

  mandatory_requirements:
    title: "MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS"
    requirements:
      - "Verify my work first: Check all my changes for errors, incomplete sections, or inconsistencies"
      - "Follow EXACT Amauta pattern: Continue using ai-q/03_node_specifications/12_Amauta/ as template"
      - "Maintain comprehensive cross-references in main files to their modules"
      - "Quality standard: All modules must meet Amauta gold standard level"
      - "Update changelog with detailed audit trail for every action"
      - "HIEROS compliance: Ensure all modules follow cultural sensitivity guidelines"
