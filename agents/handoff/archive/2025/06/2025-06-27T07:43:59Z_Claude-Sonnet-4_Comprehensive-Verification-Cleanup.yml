  _known_limitations_of_my_analysis:
    title: 🚨 **KNOWN LIMITATIONS OF MY ANALYSIS**
    content: []
    items:
    - '**Narrow Focus**: Concentrated on node architectures, may have missed broader
      system design'
    - '**File Deletion Blindness**: Unaware of what service contracts/recipes provided'
    - '**Implementation Gap**: Focused on specification completeness vs. actual implementability'
    - '**Integration Ignorance**: Unclear how universal adapters would actually function
      in practice'
    - '**Overstated Claims**: May have claimed "production-ready" based on specification
      depth rather than functional completeness'
