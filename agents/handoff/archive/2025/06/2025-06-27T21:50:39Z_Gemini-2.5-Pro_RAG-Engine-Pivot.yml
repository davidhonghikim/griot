1_current_project_status:
  title: 1. Current Project Status
  content:
  - 'The project is in a stable and well-organized state. The foundational "Memory"
    layer of the backend has been successfully scaffolded into two distinct, buildable
    packages:'
  - A **comprehensive, multi-document implementation specification** for the frontend
    client has been created and is located in `ai-q/04_architecture/frontend_specs/`.
    This blueprint is sufficiently detailed for a dedicated frontend agent to begin
    parallel development immediately.
  items:
  - '`@griot-seed/storage-mongodb`: A robust client for connecting to and interacting
    with a MongoDB database for recipes and artifacts.'
  - '`@griot-seed/rag-engine`: A powerful service for creating and querying a semantic
    search index using `LlamaIndex.TS`.'
2_your_directive:
  title: 2. Your Directive
  content:
  - Your mission is to **resume Phase 1 of the backend strategic plan by integrating
    the new memory packages into the `@griot-seed/griot-kitchen` orchestrator.**
  - 'This involves the following critical steps:'
  items:
  - '**Integrate Dependencies:**'
  - 'Modify the `package.json` of `griot-kitchen` to include the local `storage-mongodb`
    and `rag-engine` packages as dependencies using the `workspace:*` protocol (e.g.,
    `"@griot-seed/storage-mongodb": "workspace:*"`).'
  - Run `npm install` in the `griot-kitchen` directory to link the local packages.
  - '**Implement Configuration:**'
  - Create a `src/config.ts` module in `griot-kitchen`.
  - Use the `dotenv` library to load environment variables. Create a `.env.example`
    file in the `packages/griot-kitchen` root defining `PORT`, `HOST`, `MONGODB_URI`,
    and `MONGODB_DB_NAME`.
  - The config module should export these variables for use throughout the application.
  - '**Initialize Services:**'
  - In `griot-kitchen/src/index.ts`, import and create instances of `StorageClient`
    and `RAGEngine`.
  - Use the configuration from `dotenv` to initialize the `StorageClient`.
  - Establish the MongoDB connection when the Express server starts.
  - '**Implement Core API Endpoints:**'
  - Refactor the placeholder endpoints in `griot-kitchen` to use the new services
    as defined in the frontend specifications.
  - Implement `GET /v1/recipes`, `POST /v1/recipes`, and `GET /v1/search?q={query}`
    to interact with the MongoDB and RAG services.
3_context__history:
  title: 3. Context & History
  content:
  - A complete history of my actions is in `agents/01_AGENT_CHANGELOG.md` under the
    entry for **2024-07-11**. This includes the creation of the detailed frontend
    specifications and the scaffolding of the backend memory packages. The instructions
    in this handoff are the direct continuation of that work.
