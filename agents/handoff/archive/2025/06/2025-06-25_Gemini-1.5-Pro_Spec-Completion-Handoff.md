# **FINAL AGENT HANDOFF: From Blueprinting to Building**

**UTC**: `[Insert Current Timestamp]`
**Agent ID**: `Gemini-1.5-Pro`

## 1. Mission Accomplished: The Engineering Blueprints are Complete

My primary directive was to transform the high-level, abstract `ai-q` specifications into a complete, consistent, and buildable set of engineering blueprints for the foundational nodes of the kOS. This mission is **100% complete**.

I have systematically deconstructed and rebuilt the specifications for the following seven core node classes:
-   **Griot**: The Primal Starseed (Lifecycle & Bootstrapping)
-   **Tohunga**: The Sensory Organ (Data Acquisition)
-   **Ronin**: The Pathfinder (Network Discovery)
-   **Musa**: The Guardian (Security & Auth)
-   **Hakim**: The Healer (System Health & Maintenance)
-   **Skald**: The Herald (Pub/Sub & Eventing)
-   **Oracle**: The Seer (Reasoning & Data Fusion)

Each of these classes now has a dedicated directory within `ai-q/03_node_specifications/` containing a rigorous five-part specification:
1.  `00_[ClassName]_Overview.md`: Defines the core purpose, cultural archetype, and HIEROS compliance.
2.  `01_[ClassName]_Architecture.md`: Details the component architecture and primary workflows.
3.  `02_[ClassName]_Data_Models.md`: Provides the exact data structures the node uses.
4.  `03_[ClassName]_KLF_API.md`: Specifies the precise KLF messages for interaction.
5.  `04_[ClassName]_Database_Schema.md`: Lays out the complete PostgreSQL schema.
6.  `05_[ClassName]_Code_Examples.md`: Gives TypeScript examples for client interaction.

The project has moved from a state of conceptual ambiguity to one of in-depth engineering clarity. The path to implementation is now clear.

## 2. Final Project State & Review

A comprehensive self-review was conducted on all 35+ generated specification documents and their relationship to the codebase. This review confirmed a high degree of consistency across the new blueprints but also **uncovered and corrected several critical errors**, including a missing API for the Griot class and multiple mismatches between the specifications and the core KLF protocol types.

**The most critical finding is the expected gap between these new blueprints and the legacy codebase.** The code in `src/` represents a prototype; the specifications in `ai-q/` represent the production-ready architecture. A detailed report can be found in `agents/06_Final_Review_And_Analysis.md`.

-   **Project**: `griot-node`
-   **Overall Status**: Core Specifications 100% Complete. Ready for Implementation Phase.
-   **Key Asset**: The `ai-q/03_node_specifications/` directory is the **single source of truth** for all future development. It contains the complete, canonical blueprints.
-   **Updated `README.md`**: The project's main README now accurately reflects the new structure and status.
-   **Execution Plan**: The `agents/Execution_Plan.md` has been fully updated, marking the completion of the specification phase.

## 3. **NEXT AGENT: Your Directive**

Your mission is to begin the **Implementation Phase**. You will bring these blueprints to life by writing the TypeScript code for each node. **The specifications are your single source of truth.**

**Your workflow should be as follows:**

1.  **Read the Analysis**: Before you begin, read `agents/06_Final_Review_And_Analysis.md` to fully understand the state of the project and the relationship between the specs and the code.
2.  **Select a Node Class**: Start with a foundational node. The **Skald (Pub/Sub)** or **Musa (Security)** are excellent choices as many other nodes will depend on them.
3.  **Study the Blueprint**: Thoroughly read all specification documents for your chosen class in its `ai-q/03_node_specifications/` subdirectory.
4.  **Implement the Node**:
    -   Create the node's main file in `src/nodes/`, replacing any old prototypes.
    -   Implement the KLF message handlers as defined in the `03_*_KLF_API.md`, potentially enhancing the core message builders in `src/core/protocol/types.ts` as needed.
    -   Use the data models from `02_*_Data_Models.md` for all internal types.
    -   Assume the database schema from `04_*_Database_Schema.md` is available.
5.  **Test Your Implementation**: Use the examples in `05_*_Code_Examples.md` as a guide to create integration tests for your new node.
6.  **Work Incrementally**: Implement and test one node class completely before moving to the next.
7.  **Update the Plan**: Log your progress meticulously in the `agents/Execution_Plan.md`.

This is no longer a project of discovery and definition. It is a project of engineering execution. Follow the blueprints precisely.

**The foundation is laid. It is time to build.**
