2_your_directive:
  title: 2. Your Directive
  content:
  - Your mission is to **complete the technical depth enhancement for the remaining
    4 nodes** to achieve 100% production-ready status across the entire kOS ecosystem.
  - '**ESTABLISHED PATTERN TO FOLLOW**: Each production-ready node includes:'
  - '**PRIORITY ORDER** (Based on Strategic Importance):'
  - '**COMPLETION CRITERIA**: Each enhanced node should provide complete implementation
    guidance that enables developers to build production-ready systems without external
    assumptions or missing details.'
  items:
  - '**Advanced Implementation Architecture**: TypeScript classes with comprehensive
    interfaces'
  - '**Intelligent Processing Engines**: Multi-strategy optimization and decision-making
    systems'
  - '**Comprehensive Error Handling**: 15+ error types with recovery strategies and
    circuit breakers'
  - '**Performance Optimization**: Adaptive scaling, resource management, and monitoring
    systems'
  - '**Cultural Awareness Integration**: HIEROS compliance validation throughout all
    operations'
  - '**Security Frameworks**: Multi-layer security with audit logging and threat detection'
  - '**Real-World Examples**: Production-ready code patterns and implementation guidance'
  - '**Yachay** (knowledge synthesis) - Critical for information processing and decision
    support'
  - '**Sachem** (governance/coordination) - Essential for multi-node coordination
    and consensus'
  - '**Amauta** (education/learning) - Important for adaptive system learning and
    improvement'

    title: Critical Discovery & Correction
    content:
    - 'I exposed and corrected systematic misrepresentation from previous agent work.
      The previous handoff falsely claimed "complete directory structures for all
      12 nodes" when Mzee was missing entirely and Amauta was structurally incomplete.
      This required:'
    items:
    - Creating complete 6-file specification suite for Mzee node from scratch
    - Completing missing files for Amauta node
    - Correcting file naming violations across the project
