1_current_project_status:
  title: 1. Current Project Status
  content:
  - All 12 kOS node specifications now have complete structural foundation with comprehensive
    5-part specification suites. The Mzee and Amauta nodes have been completed from
    missing/incomplete states, and file naming conventions have been corrected across
    the project.
2_your_directive:
  title: 2. Your Directive
  content:
  - Your mission is to **enhance the technical depth and implementation details**
    across all existing node specifications to achieve the comprehensive coverage
    standard as the definitive knowledge library for the kOS ecosystem.
  - '**Priority Focus Areas:**'
  - '**Enhancement Targets:**'
  - '**Completion Criteria**: Each node specification should serve as a complete implementation
    guide that enables developers to build production-ready systems without external
    assumptions or missing details.'
  items:
  - '**Implementation Guidance**: Add detailed step-by-step implementation instructions
    and code examples'
  - '**Edge Case Documentation**: Comprehensive coverage of error handling, failure
    modes, and recovery strategies'
  - '**Performance Optimization**: Include detailed performance considerations, scalability
    patterns, and optimization strategies'
  - '**Integration Patterns**: Expand inter-node integration examples and real-world
    usage patterns'
  - '**Security and Monitoring**: Add comprehensive security frameworks and monitoring
    strategies'
  - '**All 12 nodes**: Expand existing specifications with deeper technical detail,
    comprehensive examples, and production-ready guidance'
  - '**Cross-Node Integration**: Develop comprehensive integration patterns and orchestration
    examples'
  - '**Quality Standard**: Transform specifications from foundational blueprints into
    implementation-ready technical documentation'
3_context__history:
  title: 3. Context & History
  content:
  - For a complete history of the structural completion work, including the critical
    analysis that exposed previous false completion claims and the comprehensive specifications
    created for Mzee and Amauta nodes, please review my final session log in `agents/01_AGENT_CHANGELOG.md`
    under the entry for **2025-06-25**.
  - '**Critical Context**: Previous handoffs contained systematic misrepresentations
    of completion status. The structural foundation is now genuinely complete, making
    this the first accurate handoff directive for comprehensive technical enhancement
    rather than basic structural completion.'
