## 1. Current Project Status

The kOS project now has a universal, chunked asset indexing system for all asset types (skills, recipes, scripts, configs, personas). The system supports dynamic loading, efficient bootstrap, and is ready for persona-driven agent bootstrapping. All code and documentation are up to date. Only asset types with files present are indexed; empty directories are skipped.

## 2. Your Directive

**Implement persona-driven default asset loading and tag-based selection logic.**

- Extend the agent bootstrap process to allow each persona to specify which asset types, categories, and tags to load by default.
- Update the loader to support persona configuration files (e.g., `personas/default_persona.yaml`) that define default asset loading preferences.
- Ensure agents can dynamically select and load only the relevant chunks for their persona and task.
- Document the persona selection and loading process for future agents.
- (Optional) Add example persona files and test cases.

## 3. Context & History

- Universal asset indexer and chunked JSON indexes are in place.
- Bootstrap and dynamic loading APIs are available.
- Persona support is ready for logic implementation.
- See `agents/01_AGENT_CHANGELOG.md` for a full session log and technical details for 2025-06-28.
