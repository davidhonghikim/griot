1_current_project_status:
  title: 1. Current Project Status
  content:
  - The project's seven core node classes have been fully specified and reviewed,
    and a new mandatory agent workflow has been implemented to ensure consistency.
    The `ai-q/03_node_specifications/` directory is now highly organized and contains
    the authoritative blueprints for development.
2_your_directive:
  title: 2. Your Directive
  content:
  - Your mission is to complete the specification work for the **remaining 5 conceptual
    node classes**.
  - 'You will create a complete, five-part specification suite for each of the following
    nodes, following the exact structure, format, and quality standard established
    by the first 8 classes:'
  - For each class, you must create a new subdirectory and the five corresponding
    specification documents (`Overview`, `Architecture`, `Data Models`, `KLF API`,
    `Database Schema`). You will need to research the cultural archetype and design
    an appropriate technical function for each.
  items:
  - '**Yachay Node (Andean)**'
  - '**Sachem Node (Algonquian)**'
  - '**Archon Node (Byzantine)**'
  - '**Amauta Node (Incan)**'
