  title: 1. Current Project Status
  content:
  - The kOS project now has a **complete, generic, and extensible AI pricing and self-hosting
    cost system**. The system is designed to handle hundreds of AI providers without
    code changes, with external configuration files for all pricing data and provider
    specifications. The token calculator, budget manager, and media processing systems
    are all integrated and ready for use.
