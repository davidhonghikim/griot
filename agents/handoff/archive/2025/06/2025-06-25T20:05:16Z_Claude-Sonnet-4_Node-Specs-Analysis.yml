1_current_project_status:
  title: 1. Current Project Status
  content:
  - The kOS project has 8 complete node specifications with graduate thesis-level
    quality (600-1000+ lines each), but 5 critical node classes remain as stub files
    with only 35-43 lines each. The project is 62% complete with Foundation and Service
    tiers finished, but Governance (33% complete) and Elder (0% complete) tiers require
    immediate attention.

  title: 2. Your Directive
  content:
  - Your mission is to **complete the full 5-part specification suite for the remaining
    5 node classes** following the exact structure, format, and quality standards
    established by the completed nodes.
  - '**Priority Order:**'
  - '**Requirements for each node:**'
  items:
  - '**Yachay Node (Quechua)** - The Memory Starseed / Hippocampus function'
  - '**Sachem Node (Algonquian)** - The Consensus Starseed / Nerve Ganglion function'
  - '**Archon Node (Byzantine)** - The Orchestrator Starseed / Central Nervous System
    function'

  - Create subdirectory under `ai-q/03_node_specifications/`
  - 'Generate 5 complete specification files: `00_Overview.md`, `01_Architecture.md`,
    `02_Data_Models.md`, `03_KLF_API.md`, `04_Database_Schema.md`'
  - Achieve 600-1000+ lines total per node class

  title: 3. Context & History
  content:
  - For a complete history of the actions that led to this handoff, including my comprehensive
    project analysis identifying the critical completion gap and quality standards,
    please review my final session log in `agents/01_AGENT_CHANGELOG.md` under the
    entry for **2025-01-27**.
  - '**Critical Reference:** Use existing complete nodes (Griot, Tohunga, Ronin, Musa,
    Hakim, Skald, Oracle, Junzi) as quality templates. The established pattern is
    non-negotiable.'
