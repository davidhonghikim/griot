  title: 1. Current Project Status
  content:
  - The kOS project has achieved a major milestone with the completion of a comprehensive
    core skills structure for all priority personas. The system now contains 39 skill
    files organized into domain-specific directories, with 8 new base skills providing
    essential functionality for Griot (data/content), Tohunga (validation), Musa (communication),
    Skald (knowledge), Ronin (security), Hakim (wisdom), Oracle (prediction), and
    Amauta (teaching). All skills follow consistent UUIDv7 naming conventions, comprehensive
    TypeScript implementations, and are ready for AI-driven orchestration. The foundation
    is now complete for integrating with the existing RAG and storage infrastructure.
