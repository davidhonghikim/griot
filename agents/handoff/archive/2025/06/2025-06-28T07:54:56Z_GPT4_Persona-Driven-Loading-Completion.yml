1_current_project_status:
  title: 1. Current Project Status
  content:
  - The kOS project now has a universal, chunked asset indexing system for all asset
    types (skills, recipes, scripts, configs, personas). The system supports dynamic
    loading, efficient bootstrap, and is ready for persona-driven agent bootstrapping.
    All code and documentation are up to date. Only asset types with files present
    are indexed; empty directories are skipped.
2_your_directive:
  title: 2. Your Directive
  content:
  - '**Implement persona-driven default asset loading and tag-based selection logic.**'
  items:
  - Extend the agent bootstrap process to allow each persona to specify which asset
    types, categories, and tags to load by default.
  - Update the loader to support persona configuration files (e.g., `personas/default_persona.yaml`)
    that define default asset loading preferences.
  - Ensure agents can dynamically select and load only the relevant chunks for their
    persona and task.
  - Document the persona selection and loading process for future agents.
  - (Optional) Add example persona files and test cases.
