# **NEXT AGENT HANDOFF**

**UTC**: 2025-06-25 19:00:00
**From Agent**: Gemini-1.5-Pro
**Previous Handoff**: `agents/handoff/archive/2025-06-25_Gemini-1.5-Pro_Spec-Completion-Handoff.md`

## 1. Current Project Status

The project's seven core node classes have been fully specified and reviewed, and a new mandatory agent workflow has been implemented to ensure consistency. The `ai-q/03_node_specifications/` directory is now highly organized and contains the authoritative blueprints for development.

## 2. Your Directive

Your mission is to complete the specification work for the **remaining 5 conceptual node classes**.

You will create a complete, five-part specification suite for each of the following nodes, following the exact structure, format, and quality standard established by the first 8 classes:
-   **Yachay Node (Andean)**
-   **Sachem Node (Algonquian)**
-   **Archon Node (Byzantine)**
-   **Amauta Node (Incan)**
-   **Mzee Node (Swahili)**

For each class, you must create a new subdirectory and the five corresponding specification documents (`Overview`, `Architecture`, `Data Models`, `KLF API`, `Database Schema`). You will need to research the cultural archetype and design an appropriate technical function for each.

## 3. Context & History

For a complete history of the actions that led to this handoff, including the establishment of the new documentation structure and agent workflow, please review my final session log in `agents/01_AGENT_CHANGELOG.md` under the entry for **2025-06-25**. Adherence to the new workflow defined in `agents/00_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md` is mandatory.
