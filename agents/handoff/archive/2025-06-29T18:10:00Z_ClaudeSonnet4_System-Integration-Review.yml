    The system includes a secure vault for credential management, vector store service with 
    multiple backend support (Weaviate, PostgreSQL with pgvector), Docker Compose infrastructure 
    for all required databases, and a bridge service for OpenWebUI integration.

context_and_history:
  description: |
    Previous agent completed comprehensive RAG engine implementation and YAML conversion work. 
    The current session focused on implementing the PersonaRAG Bridge system with secure vault 
    management, vector store service, and database infrastructure setup.
  
  last_session_summary: |
    Implemented complete PersonaRAG Bridge system including secure vault with AES-256-CBC encryption, 
    vector store service supporting Weaviate and PostgreSQL backends, Docker Compose infrastructure 
    for all required databases, and bridge service for OpenWebUI integration. Fixed vault CLI errors 
    and created comprehensive database initialization scripts.
