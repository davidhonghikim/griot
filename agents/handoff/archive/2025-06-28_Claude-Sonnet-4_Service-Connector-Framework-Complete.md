# **NEXT AGENT HANDOFF**

**UTC**: 2025-06-28T02:14:30Z
**From Agent**: Claude-Sonnet-4
**Previous Handoff**: `agents/handoff/archive/2025-06-28_Claude-Sonnet-4_System-Analysis-Correction.md`

## 1. Current Project Status

The service connector framework replacement mission has revealed that a comprehensive system already exists with 21 connectors across 5 categories. The framework implements the "universal adapter" pattern from kai-cd but requires completion of proper protocol handling and build fixes.

**Critical Discovery**: The framework is much more advanced than the original handoff indicated. Rather than needing to be built from scratch, it needs protocol fallback logic, type system completion, and final build verification.

## 2. Your Directive

Complete the service connector framework by implementing **smart protocol fallback logic** (HTTPS-first with HTTP fallback for local services), fix remaining build issues, and verify the complete system works properly with the griot-kitchen orchestrator.

## 3. Context & History

For a complete history of the actions that led to this handoff, please review my final session log in `agents/changelogs/2025/06/01_AGENT_CHANGELOG.md` under the entry for **2025-06-28T02:14:30Z**.

## 4. Project Artifacts & Current State

### 4.1. Service Connector Framework (85% COMPLETE)

The framework implements the universal adapter pattern with comprehensive service definitions.

**Directory**: `packages/service-connectors/`
**Status**: Types implemented, 21 connectors defined, build issues remain

**Key Files**:
- `src/types.ts`: Complete type system (recently implemented)
- `src/all.ts`: Registry with category organization and lookup functions
- `src/index.ts`: Barrel exports for clean API

**Connector Categories** (21 total):
- **AI Models** (10): OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, llama.cpp, LM Studio, vLLM, Hugging Face, Open WebUI, OpenAI-compatible, Civitai
- **Image Generation** (2): ComfyUI, Automatic1111
- **Storage** (5): MongoDB, ChromaDB, Qdrant, Milvus, Dropbox
- **Automation** (1): n8n
- **Networking** (1): Reticulum

### 4.2. Protocol Strategy (PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED)

**Current State**:
- Cloud services correctly use HTTPS: OpenAI, Anthropic, HuggingFace, Civitai, Dropbox
- Local services correctly use HTTP: Ollama, ComfyUI, A1111, llama.cpp, LM Studio, vLLM (Local could use https if implemented, so default to use first, then fallback to http)
- Vector databases updated to HTTPS: MongoDB, ChromaDB, Qdrant, Milvus

**Missing**: Smart fallback logic - services should attempt HTTPS first, then fallback to HTTP for local deployments.

### 4.3. Build Issues (IDENTIFIED)

**Remaining TypeScript Errors**:
1. Vector database endpoints missing `query`, `upsert`, `delete` in Milvus/Qdrant
2. ComfyUI parameter mapping extensions need proper type definitions
3. A1111 `dependsOn` parameter property needs type support
4. Authentication `defaultValue` property needs type support

---

## 5. DETAILED EXECUTION PLAN

Your mission is to complete the service connector framework with proper protocol handling and build verification.

### **Phase 1: Fix Build Issues (CRITICAL)**

1. **Complete Vector Database Types**: Update Milvus and Qdrant connectors to include required `query`, `upsert`, `delete` endpoints to match VectorDatabaseCapability interface.

2. **Fix ComfyUI Parameter Mapping**: The ComfyUI connector uses advanced parameter mapping for graph-based workflows. Ensure the type system properly supports this pattern.

3. **Complete Authentication Types**: Add support for `defaultValue` in AuthDefinition for services like LM Studio and vLLM.

4. **Test Build**: Verify `npm run build` completes successfully.

### **Phase 2: Implement Protocol Fallback Logic**

1. **Design Smart Protocol Detection**: Create a connection utility that:
   - Attempts HTTPS first for all services
   - Falls back to HTTP if HTTPS fails (for local services)
   - Caches successful protocol per service instance
   - Handles both cloud and local deployment scenarios

2. **Update Service Definitions**: Modify the ServiceDefinition interface to support:
   - Primary protocol (https/http)
   - Fallback protocol capability
   - Connection retry logic

3. **Create Connection Manager**: Implement a service connection manager that handles protocol negotiation automatically.

### **Phase 3: Integration & Verification**

1. **Test with griot-kitchen**: Ensure the service-connectors package can be imported and used by the griot-kitchen orchestrator.

2. **Create Usage Examples**: Implement simple test cases showing how to:
   - Connect to cloud services (OpenAI, Anthropic)
   - Connect to local services (Ollama, ComfyUI)
   - Handle protocol fallback scenarios

3. **Verify All Connectors**: Test that all 21 connectors have proper type definitions and can be instantiated.

## 6. Critical Technical Details

### 6.1. Universal Adapter Pattern

The framework implements a sophisticated universal adapter pattern where:
- Each service is defined declaratively through ServiceDefinition
- Capabilities are modular (LLM, ImageGen, VectorDB, etc.)
- Parameters are self-describing with validation rules
- Complex services like ComfyUI use parameter mapping for graph workflows

### 6.2. Protocol Handling Strategy

**Current Implementation**:
```typescript
protocol: 'https' | 'http'  // Static per service
```

**Required Enhancement**:
```typescript
protocol: {
  primary: 'https' | 'http',
  fallback?: 'https' | 'http',
  autoDetect?: boolean
}
```

### 6.3. Key Architecture Files

- `types.ts`: Core interfaces and type definitions
- `all.ts`: Service registry with category organization
- `ai-models/`: 10 AI service connectors
- `storage/`: 5 storage service connectors (including vector DBs)
- `image-generation/`: 2 image generation service connectors

---

## 7. Success Criteria

**Phase 1 Complete**: `npm run build` succeeds with zero TypeScript errors
**Phase 2 Complete**: Protocol fallback logic implemented and tested
**Phase 3 Complete**: Integration with griot-kitchen verified, all connectors functional

**Final Deliverable**: A robust, production-ready service connector framework that can adapt to any service through declarative definitions with smart protocol handling for both cloud and local deployments.

---

## 8. Context & Constraints

**Time Constraint**: Context window is full - prioritize getting the build working first, then implement the protocol fallback logic.

**Quality Emphasis**: User emphasized "do it right" - focus on proper implementation over quick compilation fixes.

**Local Service Priority**: Many users will run local services (Ollama, ComfyUI, etc.) that don't support HTTPS. The fallback mechanism is essential for real-world usage.

This framework will be the foundation for the entire kOS orchestration system - it must be robust, flexible, and handle real-world deployment scenarios properly.
