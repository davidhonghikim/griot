  description: |
    kOS project with fully integrated backend infrastructure including database services (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Weaviate, Redis, Neo4j) 
    running via Docker Compose, and a PersonaRAG Bridge server that's partially functional but encountering OpenAI API key 
    authentication issues. The system includes comprehensive RAG services, vector store integration, and modular architecture, 
    but requires proper API key configuration to complete end-to-end testing.
  
  phase: "API_KEY_RESOLUTION_AND_TESTING"
  infrastructure: "Complete database stack operational via Docker Compose"
  system_components:
    - "PersonaRAG Bridge Service (port 3000) - PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL"
    - "Secure Vault System (AES-256-CBC encryption) - OPERATIONAL"
    - "Vector Store Service (Weaviate + PostgreSQL support) - OPERATIONAL"
    - "OpenWebUI Integration Bridge - READY FOR TESTING"
    - "Docker Compose Infrastructure - FULLY OPERATIONAL"
    - "Comprehensive Testing Framework - READY"

context_and_history:
  description: |
    Previous agent completed comprehensive system integration including database infrastructure, RAG services, 
    and PersonaRAG Bridge implementation. The current session identified API key authentication issues and 
    provided a test API key for resolution.
  
  last_session_summary: |
    Identified OpenAI API key authentication issue in PersonaRAG Bridge server. The server is using a mock 
    API key instead of the real OpenAI API key, causing authentication failures. Database infrastructure 
    is fully operational via Docker Compose. Test API key provided for resolution.
