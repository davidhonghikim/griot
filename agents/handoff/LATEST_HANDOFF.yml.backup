# **NEXT AGENT HANDOFF**

**UTC**: 2025-06-30T21:55:00Z
**From Agent**: Claude Sonnet 4
**Previous Handoff**: `agents/handoff/archive/2025-06-30_ClaudeSonnet4_ServiceForm-Fixes.yml`

---

## 1. Current Project Status

PersonaRAG Bridge extension now builds successfully with zero TypeScript errors. ServiceForm component properly handles all authentication types (none, api_key, jwt, login) with correct type safety. Agent workflow documentation updated with mandatory .bak method for risky edits.

## 2. Your Directive

Continue implementing the comprehensive service authentication system. Test the ServiceForm component to ensure all authentication options work correctly. Implement the remaining UI/UX improvements including dark mode enforcement, proper navigation buttons, and service management features. Ensure all services can be configured with the appropriate authentication method.
