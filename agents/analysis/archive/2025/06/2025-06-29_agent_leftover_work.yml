project_review_summary:
  initial_assessment: |
    Based on my comprehensive project review, I can see the current state clearly. There are 5 node architectures 
    with modular breakdowns, but one (Griot) is incomplete - the modules exist but the main architecture file 
    hasn't been transformed yet. Let me complete this first.
  
  griot_architecture_transformation:
    initial_state: "Now I'll transform the Griot Architecture file from its current 750-line detailed implementation to a clean modular overview following the Amauta gold standard pattern."
    completion: "Perfect! I've successfully completed the Griot Architecture transformation. Let me verify the new line count and update my changelog."
    final_result: "Excellent! The Griot Architecture transformation is complete - successfully reduced from 750 lines to 192 lines following the gold standard pattern."

next_actions:
  continuation_plan: |
    Since the user requested to continue until all missing work is complete, I'll proceed with the next priority target: 
    Griot KLF API (791 lines). This will require creating 4 new modules following the proven Amauta methodology.
  
  griot_klf_api_analysis:
    understanding: "Perfect! I now understand the complete Griot KLF API structure. It's a comprehensive 792-line specification that I can break down into 4 logical modules following the proven methodology. Let me start creating the modular breakdown."
  
  module_creation_progress:
    module_1: "Perfect! Module 1 is complete. Now I'll create the second module for Advanced Configuration & Parameters."
    module_2: "Perfect! Module 2 is complete. Let me update my changelog and continue with the remaining modules."
    module_3: "Now I'll create module 3 for Progress Tracking & Status Management:"
    module_4: "I see there might be some file system issues. Let me proceed with creating the fourth and final module to complete the Griot KLF API modular breakdown."
