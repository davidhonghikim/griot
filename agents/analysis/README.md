# **Agent Analysis Directory**

This directory contains comprehensive analyses performed by agents during development sessions. These analyses provide detailed insights into project state, technical architecture, implementation readiness, and strategic recommendations.

## **Directory Structure**

```

## **Archive Policy**

> **Note:** All analysis archives are stored in `agents/analysis/archive/`, organized by year and month. Do not use the centralized `agents/archive/` directory for analysis archives.

### **Current Month Access**
- **Location**: Root of analysis directory
- **Purpose**: Easy access to recent analyses
- **Naming**: `[YYYY-MM-DD]_[analysis_name].md`

### **Monthly Archiving**
- **Trigger**: Monthly (or manual when needed)
- **Destination**: `archive/[YYYY]/[MM]/`
- **Benefits**: 
  - Keeps root directory clean
  - Maintains chronological organization
  - Preserves historical context

### **Archive Structure**
```
archive/
└── [YEAR]/
    ├── [01]/  # January
    ├── [02]/  # February
    ├── ...
    └── [12]/  # December
```

### **Archive Process**
1. **Monthly**: Move all files from previous month to archive
2. **Update Index**: Maintain references in `00_Analysis_Index.md`
3. **Preserve Context**: Keep metadata and cross-references intact

### **Automated Archiving**
- **Script Location**: `scripts/archiving/archive_monthly.sh`
- **Usage**: 
  ```bash
  # Archive all systems
  ./scripts/archiving/archive_monthly.sh
  
  # Archive specific system
  ./scripts/archiving/archive_monthly.sh agents/analysis
  ```
- **Features**: 
  - Archives files from previous months only
  - Maintains current month files in root directory
  - Creates proper year/month directory structure
  - Handles both `.md` and `.json` files

## **Purpose**

The analysis system serves as a **knowledge repository** for agent insights and technical evaluations. Each analysis provides:

- **Technical Assessment**: Detailed evaluation of code, architecture, and systems
- **Implementation Readiness**: Phase-based implementation plans with effort estimates
- **Risk Assessment**: Identified risks and mitigation strategies
- **Strategic Recommendations**: Actionable next steps and priorities
- **Success Criteria**: Measurable outcomes and quality metrics

## **Analysis Types**

### **Technical Architecture Analysis**
- System design evaluations
- Performance assessments
- Integration gap analysis
- Scalability reviews

### **Implementation Readiness Analysis**
- Feature completion status
- Dependency analysis
- Effort estimation
- Risk assessment

### **Strategic Planning Analysis**
- Roadmap development
- Priority recommendations
- Success metrics definition
- Resource allocation

### **Quality Assurance Analysis**
- Code quality reviews
- Testing strategy analysis
- Documentation completeness
- Performance benchmarking

## **Integration with Agent Workflow**

### **Analysis Creation**
Analyses are created when:
1. **Major Milestone Completion**: After significant feature implementation
2. **Integration Reviews**: Before major system integrations
3. **Performance Assessments**: When performance targets are at risk
4. **Strategic Planning**: For roadmap and priority decisions
5. **Risk Mitigation**: When critical issues are identified

### **Analysis Utilization**
- **Changelog Integration**: All analyses logged in `agents/01_AGENT_CHANGELOG.md`
- **Handoff References**: Relevant analyses cited in handoff documents
- **Implementation Guidance**: Analysis findings guide development priorities
- **Knowledge Continuity**: Insights preserved across agent sessions

### **Analysis Archiving**
Completed analyses are archived to:
- `agents/archive/analysis/` for historical reference
- Maintain project knowledge continuity
- Support future decision-making
- Preserve technical insights

## **Quality Standards**

### **Analysis Requirements**
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All relevant aspects must be addressed
- **Evidence-Based**: Findings must be supported by code review and testing
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Clear next steps with effort estimates
- **Measurable Outcomes**: Success criteria must be quantifiable
- **Risk Assessment**: Potential issues and mitigation strategies

### **Analysis Quality Metrics**
- **Completeness**: All relevant aspects covered
- **Accuracy**: Technical details verified
- **Actionability**: Clear next steps provided
- **Impact**: Analysis influences project direction
- **Timeliness**: Reflects current project state

## **File Naming Convention**

### **Analysis Files**
- Format: `[YYYY-MM-DD]_[analysis_name].md`
- Example: `2025-06-29_comprehensive_project_analysis.md`

### **Directory Organization**
- Year-based organization: `2025/`, `2026/`, etc.
- Chronological ordering within years
- Consistent naming across all analysis files

## **Template Usage**

All analyses follow the standard template defined in `00_Analysis_Index.md`:

```markdown
---
title: "[Analysis Title]"
version: "1.0"
status: "Analysis"
created: "[YYYY-MM-DD]"
updated: "[YYYY-MM-DD]"
author: "[Agent Name]"
