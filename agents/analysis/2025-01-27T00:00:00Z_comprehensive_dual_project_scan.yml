observations:
  content_maturity:
    griot_node: "Highly structured, YAML-dominant (73%), focused on implementation"
    kai_cd: "Mixed format, Markdown-heavy (48%), focused on exploration and planning"
  documentation_strategy:
    griot_node: "Systematic, modular approach with clear separation of concerns"
    kai_cd: "Comprehensive but less organized, extensive brainstorming content"
  technical_depth:
    griot_node: "Implementation-ready specifications with detailed technical requirements"
    kai_cd: "Conceptual and exploratory content with extensive architectural thinking"

recommendations:
  griot_node_development:
    - "Content Integration: Consider mining kai-cd for valuable conceptual content"
    - "Documentation Enhancement: Leverage kai-cd's extensive brainstorming for feature planning"
    - "Architecture Validation: Cross-reference current specifications with kai-cd's architectural evolution"
  knowledge_management:
    - "Reference Consolidation: Continue organizing reference materials systematically"
    - "Content Migration: Identify high-value content from kai-cd for potential migration"
    - "Documentation Standards: Maintain YAML-first approach for consistency"
  project_evolution:
    - "Historical Context: Use kai-cd as a reference for understanding design decisions"
    - "Feature Planning: Leverage kai-cd's extensive future planning for roadmap development"
    - "Architecture Validation: Cross-reference current designs with historical architectural thinking"

next_steps:
  - "Content Mining: Identify specific high-value content from kai-cd for potential integration"
  - "Architecture Review: Compare current griot-node architecture with kai-cd's extensive architectural thinking"
  - "Documentation Enhancement: Use kai-cd's comprehensive content to fill gaps in current specifications"
  - "Reference Organization: Continue systematic organization of reference materials"
