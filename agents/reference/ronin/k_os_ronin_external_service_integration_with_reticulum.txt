# kOS Ronin - Connecting External Services to Reticulum Network

Node Class: **Ronin (Nomadic Starseed)**

---

## ✅ Integration Overview

To connect external services (e.g., web apps, APIs, databases, external agents) to the Reticulum mesh, you need to implement a **service bridge or adapter** that can:

1. **Speak Reticulum**: Using Reticulum’s Python API or a Reticulum-compatible protocol handler.
2. **Expose a Local API or Connector**: HTTP, gRPC, WebSocket, or CLI interface that your external service can use.
3. **Handle Identity + Encryption**: Reticulum uses cryptographic identities, destination keys, and packet signing for all communication.

## ✅ Recommended Patterns for External Service Integration

| Integration Pattern | Description |
|---|---|
| **Python Service Adapters** | Write Reticulum-native microservices in Python that talk directly over Reticulum |
| **Local TCP-to-Reticulum Proxy** | Run a small TCP server locally that listens for external service traffic and forwards it as Reticulum packets |
| **HTTP-to-Reticulum Bridge** | Expose local HTTP endpoints (like our Ronin API server) that internally send/receive Reticulum packets |
| **MQTT/Message Broker Gateway** | Bridge MQTT topics (or other queues) into Reticulum pubsub topics |
| **gRPC-to-Reticulum Stub** | Expose a gRPC service that proxies calls into Reticulum |

## ✅ Required Reticulum Python Modules
- `reticulum`
- `RNS` (Reticulum Network Stack Python module)
- `Destination`, `Identity`, `Packet`, `Channel`, etc.

(Available via [https://github.com/markqvist/Reticulum](https://github.com/markqvist/Reticulum))

## ✅ High-Level Steps:

1. **Service chooses its identity:**
   - Generate Reticulum private/public keys.
   - Optionally register with Ronin Discovery.

2. **Service listens on a Destination:**
   - Example: `Destination(service_identity, "example_service", Destination.SINGLE, Destination.PLAIN)`

3. **External apps communicate via the service adapter:**
   - E.g., External HTTP POST → Local Python Reticulum Adapter → Sends Reticulum Packet → Receives ACK/Response → Returns to HTTP client.

## ✅ Example: External Web App Posting to Reticulum

| Flow | Action |
|---|---|
| External Web App | Sends HTTP POST to Ronin REST API |
| Ronin Node API Server | Calls `reticulum_bridge.py` or Python API |
| Python Adapter | Creates and sends Reticulum Packet |
| Reticulum Mesh | Delivers packet to destination node |
| Destination Node | Processes and optionally replies |
| Ronin Server | Returns response back to original web app |

## ✅ Optional Advanced Features:
- QoS / retry handling for lossy LoRa links
- Persistent queue for store-and-forward
- Encryption and signature verification
- Multi-protocol fallback (HTTP, MQTT, Serial)
- Service-to-service mesh routing via Ronin Adaptive Router
