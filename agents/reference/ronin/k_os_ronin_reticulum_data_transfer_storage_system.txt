# kOS Ronin Reticulum-Based Data Transfer, Storage, and Communication System

Node Class: **Ronin (Nomadic Starseed)**

---

## ✅ System Overview
A full-stack, Reticulum-native, decentralized **data transfer, storage, communication, discovery, and network-mapping system**, designed for:
- LoRa (Low bandwidth, long range)
- WiFi / Ethernet (High speed)
- Hybrid dynamic-routing mesh networks

Ronin serves as the autonomous **network pathfinder, topology mapper, and adaptive router**, constantly scanning and optimizing communication routes between kOS nodes.

## ✅ System Components

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| **Reticulum Transport Core** | Handles all packet-based, link-layer-agnostic communication (LoRa, Serial, TCP, etc) |
| **Node Identity + Auth API** | Challenge-response node login, identity verification, and session management |
| **Service Discovery Engine** | Automatically scans and builds a service map of neighboring nodes and reachable endpoints |
| **Adaptive Routing Manager** | Dynamically calculates least-cost or most-reliable routes across multi-hop paths |
| **Chunked Data Transfer Layer** | LoRa-optimized and high-speed fallback aware, with retry, ACK, and error-correction logic |
| **File Storage + Indexing** | Pluggable backend: Local filesystem, Mongo, Postgres, or VectorDB for content indexing |
| **Pub/Sub + Messaging Broker** | Supports topic-based messaging, direct messages, broadcasts, and alerting |
| **BBS Service Layer (Optional)** | Distributed Bulletin Board Server, accessible via CLI and API |
| **NAS Sync + Backup Agent** | Background file sync and scheduled backup operations across mesh |
| **Hybrid HTTP Bridge (Optional)** | Local REST API fallback for non-Reticulum clients or high-speed local apps |

## ✅ Ronin API Endpoints (Available via Reticulum and Optional HTTP)

| API | Description |
|---|---|
| `/api/ronin/login` | Node authentication (signed payload or destination handshake) |
| `/api/ronin/discover` | Trigger service discovery or network topology refresh |
| `/api/ronin/routes` | Query current routing table and link costs |
| `/api/ronin/upload` | Upload file/data (chunked with retry support) |
| `/api/ronin/download` | Request file/data download (range and resumable) |
| `/api/ronin/message/send` | Direct node-to-node messaging |
| `/api/ronin/pubsub/subscribe` | Subscribe to a mesh topic |
| `/api/ronin/pubsub/publish` | Publish message to topic |
| `/api/ronin/bbs/post` | Post to distributed BBS board |
| `/api/ronin/bbs/thread` | Retrieve BBS thread messages |
| `/api/ronin/storage/list` | List stored files or indexed content |
| `/api/ronin/sync/backup` | Trigger backup or NAS sync job |
| `/api/ronin/metrics` | Report node link stats, throughput, and error rates |

---

## ✅ Connection Type Optimization

| Link Type | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **LoRa / Serial / Low-Speed** | Chunked packets, aggressive compression, queued delivery, low-MTU framing |
| **WiFi / Ethernet / TCP** | Bulk streaming, encrypted sessions, faster retry windows |
| **Hybrid / Mixed Mesh** | Dynamic per-hop strategy selection (auto-detect link characteristics) |

---

## ✅ Unique Ronin Features
- **Dynamic Route Costing (Latency + Reliability Weighted)**
- **Decentralized Service Registry / Node Metadata Map**
- **Auto-Healing Route Reconfiguration**
- **Mesh-wide Discovery-to-Action API Chaining**
- **Low Power Mode Scheduling for energy-constrained nodes**
- **Burst Mode for high-priority traffic**
- **Offline Store and Forward Queues**
- **Ephemeral File Transfer Channels**

---

## ✅ Next Optional Steps:
- Generate **OpenAPI 3 Spec** for the Ronin API layer
- Build **Node.js Reticulum API server with Python Reticulum module adapter**
- Design **CLI tools for network diagnostics, routing trace, and peer monitoring**
- Create **Ronin Route Optimizer Module (dynamic cost analysis and failover)**
- Build **Offline Delay-Tolerant Message Queue Processor**
