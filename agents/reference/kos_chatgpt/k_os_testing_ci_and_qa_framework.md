# kOS Testing, CI, and QA Framework

## Overview
The **kOS Testing, CI, and QA Framework (TCQF)** defines the complete quality assurance pipeline for all code, modules, agents, and system layers within the kOS ecosystem. It ensures that every software artifact is rigorously tested, ethically reviewed, security audited, and deployment-ready before reaching production.

## Core Testing Principles

| Principle                  | Description                                 |
|------------------------ |-------------------------------------- |
| Test Everything           | All code paths, configs, and deployment scripts must have test coverage |
| Shift-Left Testing         | Ethical, security, and performance tests happen early in the development cycle |
| Continuous Verification   | All build stages include automated testing and validation |
| Ethics-Integrated QA       | JUNZI filters applied at test time for ethical compliance validation |
| Modular Test Design        | Tests written at unit, module, and system levels |

---

## Test Types and Coverage

| Test Type               | Target Level                        |
|-------------------- |--------------------------------- |
| Unit Tests            | Individual functions and logic branches |
| Integration Tests      | Module interdependencies and API interactions |
| Ethics Tests           | Validate ethical compliance under various scenarios |
| Security Tests         | OWASP Top 10 vulnerability checks, dependency scans |
| Performance Tests      | Load, stress, and latency testing   |
| Regression Tests       | Ensure previous features remain functional |
| End-to-End Tests       | Full system workflows from user to agent to storage |
| Deployment Tests       | Infrastructure setup and tear-down validations |

---

## CI/CD Pipeline Stages

| Stage                    | Actions Performed                               |
|--------------------- |-------------------------------------------- |
| Pre-Commit              | Linting, static code analysis               |
| Build Stage             | Compile, package, and containerize modules  |
| Unit Test Stage         | Run all unit tests                          |
| Integration Test Stage  | Test agent and module interactions          |
| Ethics Filter Stage     | JUNZI ethics scan on all proposed actions and flows |
| Security Scan Stage     | Static Application Security Testing (SAST), dependency vulnerability scans |
| Performance Benchmark Stage | Optional, for critical-path modules         |
| Deployment Validation Stage | Spin up staging environment, run smoke tests |
| Post-Deployment Monitoring | Ensure new code is behaving as expected in production |

## QA Metrics and KPIs

| Metric                   | Purpose                                       |
|-------------------- |-------------------------------------- |
| Code Coverage %        | Minimum 80% required for new modules |
| Ethics Violation Count | Ethics filter block rate during testing |
| Test Pass Rate         | Overall CI success ratio            |
| Deployment Success Rate | % of successful deployments post-testing |
| Defect Density          | Bugs per thousand lines of code    |
| Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) | Time to resolve failed builds or deployments |

---

## Developer Testing Requirements

| Requirement            | Mandatory For...                    |
|------------------- |------------------------------- |
| Unit Tests           | All logic functions             |
| Ethics Tests         | Any module affecting user data, external calls, or decision-making |
| Integration Tests    | Modules with external dependencies |
| Load/Stress Tests    | Performance-sensitive modules     |
| Regression Suites    | For all critical system paths    |

---
