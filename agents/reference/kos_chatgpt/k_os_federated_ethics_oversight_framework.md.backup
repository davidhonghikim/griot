# kOS Federated Ethics Oversight Framework

## Overview
The **kOS Federated Ethics Oversight Framework (FEOF)** defines the decentralized, multi-node governance structure for managing, reviewing, and enforcing ethical policies and decisions across distributed kOS deployments. It ensures that ethics governance remains transparent, community-driven, culturally sensitive, and adaptable at global scale.

## Core Functions

| Function                      | Purpose                                 |
|--------------------------- |----------------------------------- |
| Inter-Node Ethics Coordination | Synchronize ethics rules and updates across federated nodes |
| Ethics Policy Voting        | Allow node operators and trusted entities to propose, vote, and ratify new ethics policies |
| Cross-Node Violation Reporting | Share ethics violation data across nodes for collective awareness |
| Distributed Ethics Auditing | Conduct multi-node post-incident ethics reviews |
| Node-Level Ethics Scoring   | Track each node's compliance, violation history, and ethical standing |
| Ethics Model Versioning     | Maintain clear version history of all deployed ethics models |

## Governance Structure

| Layer                        | Role                                      |
|------------------------- |------------------------------------ |
| Local Node JUNZI Layer    | Enforces real-time pre-action filters locally |
| Regional Ethics Coordination Hub | Aggregates ethics metrics and violation data from nearby nodes |
| Global Ethics Governance Council | Community-elected body for cross-network ethics rule management |
| Cultural Advisory Nodes   | Provide input on cultural sensitivity and fairness for ethics rules |

---

## Ethics Policy Lifecycle

1. **Proposal Submission:** Any authorized node, user, or council member submits new policy or rule change
2. **Ethics Impact Assessment:** Evaluate policy for ethical tradeoffs, cultural impact, and system performance implications
3. **Federated Voting:** Conduct time-limited vote among governance council and/or regional hubs
4. **Policy Ratification:** Apply quorum and consensus thresholds before adoption
5. **Version Update Broadcast:** Distribute updated ethics model to all nodes
6. **Post-Deployment Monitoring:** Track system-wide behavior changes post-policy rollout

## Federation Communication Protocols

| Protocol Layer          | Purpose                                  |
|------------------- |------------------------------------ |
| Secure Node-to-Hub Channels | For ethics data aggregation         |
| Multi-Signature Voting Ledger | For ratifying policy votes          |
| Federated Ethics API    | For cross-node ethics rule synchronization |
| Anonymized Violation Feeds | For ethics research and trend monitoring |

## Ethics Compliance Metrics (Node-Level)

| Metric                      | Purpose                                 |
|--------------------- |------------------------------------ |
| Violation Frequency Rate | Track ethics incidents per 1,000 actions |
| Ethics Quarantine Count | Number of ethics-triggered node lockdowns |
| Policy Update Latency | Time to adopt new ethics policy versions |
| User-Filed Complaints | Number of user-raised ethics concerns per node |
| Community Trust Score | Peer-reviewed ethical standing of the node |

---

## Node Responsibilities

| Node Type              | Responsibility                               |
|------------------ |-------------------------------------- |
| Standard Node        | Run local JUNZI filters, participate in data sharing |
| Regional Hub Node    | Aggregate, anonymize, and report regional ethics data |
| Governance Council Node | Vote on system-wide policy changes, review escalated violations |
| Cultural Advisory Node | Review ethics rules for cultural sensitivity |

---

## Extensibility

- Blockchain-backed voting transparency
- AI-driven policy impact prediction models
- Federated ethics simulation sandboxes
- Cross-jurisdictional cultural rule branching
