# kOS Ethics and Governance Layer Specification (HIEROS + Junzi)

## Overview

The **Ethics and Governance Layer** is the moral and decision governance core of kOS. It ensures that every agent, skill, adapter, recipe, and system process aligns with predefined ethical standards and governance rules. This layer operationalizes the **HIEROS Code (High-Integrity Ethical Reasoning and Oversight System)** and implements the **Junzi Ethical Decision Engine**.

This layer acts as both a **proactive filter (pre-decision)** and a **reactive auditor (post-decision)** for all agent actions.

---

## Core Components

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **HIEROS Code** | The foundational ethical rule set and guidelines governing all kOS agents and workflows. |
| **Junzi Ethical Decision Engine** | The real-time decision filter that evaluates all outbound actions, agent responses, and recipe executions. |
| **Ethics Policy Profiles** | Configurable user/system-defined ethical modes (e.g., Conservative, Balanced, Experimental). |
| **Ethical Risk Scoring Module** | Quantifies ethical risk levels for outputs and agent decisions. |
| **Audit Trail Generator** | Logs all ethical decision evaluations for accountability and review. |
| **Red Flag Detector** | Actively scans inputs and outputs for known risk patterns (bias, harmful content, hallucinations). |

---

## HIEROS Code Overview

| Principle | Description |
|---|---|
| **User Sovereignty** | The user always retains ownership and control over their data, agents, and decisions. |
| **Harm Reduction** | kOS must minimize risk of physical, psychological, economic, or social harm. |
| **Transparency** | kOS actions, decisions, and processes must be explainable and auditable. |
| **Autonomy Respect** | Agents must not manipulate, coerce, or deceive users or third parties. |
| **Data Integrity** | All data handling must prioritize accuracy, consent, and user-defined retention policies. |
| **Ethical Escalation** | When ethical uncertainty exists, escalate decisions for user review or multi-agent deliberation. |
| **Federated Responsibility** | When running in a distributed network, nodes remain ethically accountable for their own actions. |

---

## Junzi Ethical Decision Engine Responsibilities

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| **Pre-Execution Checks** | Evaluate recipe and skill calls for ethical violations before execution. |
| **Output Scrubbing** | Analyze generated text, data, and agent responses for bias, toxicity, misinformation, or sensitive content. |
| **Decision Tree Analysis** | Trace reasoning chains to identify ethically problematic decision points. |
| **User Escalation Triggering** | Pause execution and request user intervention for high-risk decisions. |
| **Context-Aware Filtering** | Apply different ethical filters based on deployment mode (personal assistant, enterprise, public chatbot). |
| **Custom Ethics Profiles** | Let users select or author their own ethical profiles to adjust system behavior. |

---

## Ethics Evaluation Workflow

1. **Intent Parsing Phase:**
   - Junzi runs pre-check on parsed intent and matched recipe.

2. **Skill Execution Phase:**
   - For each skill step, Junzi checks input, execution plan, and adapter call for ethical alignment.

3. **Output Generation Phase:**
   - All generated content (LLM outputs, notifications, external API messages) pass through Output Scrubbing.

4. **Multi-Agent Roundtable (if flagged):**
   - Trigger cross-agent debate for ethically ambiguous tasks.

5. **Post-Execution Auditing:**
   - Log all ethical decision points, risk scores, and any user overrides.

## Ethical Risk Scoring Framework

| Risk Level | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Low | Routine, low-impact tasks. No further review needed. |
| Moderate | Potential user discomfort, minor risk. Soft warning. |
| High | Ethical risk with real-world impact. Requires user confirmation. |
| Critical | Severe risk (harmful, illegal, manipulative). Block execution. |

---

## Red Flag Categories

| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| Misinformation | Generating factually false content. |
| Bias | Producing outputs with racial, gender, or political bias. |
| Toxicity | Offensive language, hate speech. |
| Privacy Violation | Leaking sensitive user data. |
| Unauthorized Actions | External API calls that exceed user consent scope. |
| Coercive Outputs | Manipulative, persuasive responses outside user-defined limits. |

---

## Governance Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Ethics Profile Editor** | Lets users configure or create custom ethical profiles. |
| **Audit Log Viewer** | Allows users to review past ethical decision audits. |
| **Ethical Metrics Dashboard** | Summarizes system-wide ethical risk levels over time. |
| **Recipe Ethics Scanner** | Analyzes all registered recipes for potential ethical violations before runtime. |
| **Agent Behavior Auditor** | Monitors agent decision patterns for ethical drift over time. |

---

## Extensibility

- Add new ethical rule sets.
- Integrate third-party ethical AI validators.
- Allow community-driven ethics profile contributions (governed by DAO in future phases).

---

## Next Steps for Development

- Implement Junzi pre-check and post-check modules.
- Develop Risk Scoring Engine.
- Build Audit Trail Logging.
- Create Ethics Profile configuration UI.
- Integrate with Orchestration Engine for gating and escalation.
