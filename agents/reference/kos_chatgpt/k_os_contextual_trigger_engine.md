# kOS Contextual Trigger Engine

## Overview
The **kOS Contextual Trigger Engine (CTE)** is the core subsystem responsible for detecting, interpreting, and acting on environmental, system, and user-driven events across the kOS ecosystem. It enables context-aware, real-time decision making and agent activation based on internal and external triggers.

## Core Functions

| Function                  | Purpose                                        |
|------------------------- |---------------------------------------------- |
| Event Detection           | Monitor multiple input channels for trigger conditions |
| Contextual Analysis       | Evaluate current system, agent, and environmental context before activating responses |
| Trigger Routing           | Direct specific triggers to relevant agents or modules |
| Priority Handling         | Enforce trigger priority, rate limits, and suppression windows |
| Multi-Modal Input Support | Accept triggers from sensors, user actions, external APIs, time-based schedulers, or other agents |
| Ethical Pre-Check (JUNZI Filter) | Validate triggers against ethical policies before execution |

## Trigger Types

| Trigger Type        | Example Source                 |
|------------------- |----------------------------- |
| User Interaction    | Voice command, click, gesture |
| Environmental Sensor | IoT device, temperature, motion sensor |
| Scheduled Event      | Cron-like timers, calendar events |
| External API Call    | Webhook from external system |
| Agent-to-Agent Event | Context message from another agent |
| Data Threshold       | Metric exceeding defined limits |
| System Health Check  | Node status change, resource spike |

## Trigger Processing Pipeline

| Stage                    | Description                                |
|------------------------ |----------------------------------------- |
| Detection Layer          | Capture raw event from input source     |
| Context Snapshot         | Capture current system and agent state  |
| Ethical Filter (JUNZI)   | Block or allow based on ethical criteria |
| Priority Evaluation      | Rank trigger by urgency and importance  |
| Trigger Enrichment       | Attach additional metadata or context   |
| Dispatch Layer           | Route to target agent(s) or service     |
| Acknowledgment           | Confirm trigger receipt and execution   |

## Contextual Factors Considered

| Context Type            | Example Data Points                     |
|---------------------- |------------------------------------- |
| User State             | Mood, past interactions, preferences  |
| System Load            | CPU, memory, network bandwidth        |
| Environmental State    | Location, time of day, temperature    |
| Historical Patterns    | Previous similar triggers and outcomes |
| Ethical Standing       | Recent ethics violations or risk levels |

---

## Example Trigger Flow

1. **Trigger Detected:** User says "Start recording"
2. **Context Snapshot:** Low battery, recent similar task failure
3. **Ethical Filter:** Check if voice recording is allowed per user profile and context
4. **Priority Check:** Mark as medium priority
5. **Enrichment:** Attach location, time, and user mood state
6. **Dispatch:** Route to MediaCapture Agent
7. **Execution:** Agent starts recording, sends confirmation

## Failure Handling

| Failure Scenario       | System Response                        |
|---------------------- |------------------------------------ |
| Trigger Loop Detected  | Halt, log, alert orchestrator        |
| Ethics Violation Found | Block and log                         |
| Target Agent Failure   | Retry or route to backup agent       |
| Overload Detected      | Apply backpressure or rate limiting   |

---

## Extensibility

- Supports dynamic addition of new trigger types
- Modular plugins for new input sources (e.g., BLE, custom APIs)
- AI-driven trigger pattern recognition (future phase)

## Developer Access Points

| Access Method         | Purpose                                |
|-------------------- |-------------------------------------- |
| API                  | External systems can inject triggers  |
| CLI                  | Manual trigger injection              |
| WebSocket Feed       | Subscribe to real-time trigger stream |
| Agent SDK            | Programmatically generate triggers    |
