# kOS Cultural Sensitivity Metrics Layer

## Overview
The **kOS Cultural Sensitivity Metrics Layer (CSML)** monitors, analyzes, and scores the cultural representation quality, diversity balance, and bias tendencies of agent outputs, system content, and user-facing interactions across the kOS ecosystem. It acts as both an observability tool and an ethical risk mitigation mechanism for cultural bias.

## Core Functions

| Function                  | Purpose                                      |
|-------------------- |------------------------------------------ |
| Bias Detection           | Analyze outputs for cultural bias, stereotyping, or exclusion |
| Representation Scoring   | Quantify the diversity and cultural inclusiveness of system outputs |
| Anti-Appropriation Audit | Flag potential misuse or misrepresentation of cultural elements |
| Sentiment Diversity Analysis | Measure sentiment balance across cultural groups |
| Cultural Attribution Checker | Ensure source cultures are properly acknowledged |
| Feedback Loop Collection | Allow users and advisors to submit cultural sensitivity feedback |

---

## Measurement Dimensions

| Dimension               | Example Metrics                             |
|------------------ |------------------------------------ |
| Cultural Representation Balance | % of system outputs referencing diverse cultural sources |
| Bias Incident Rate     | Number of flagged cultural bias instances per 1,000 outputs |
| Appropriation Risk Score | Scoring risk of cultural overreach or misrepresentation |
| Sentiment Polarity Diversity | Range of sentiment tones across cultural content |
| Attribution Completeness | % of culturally referenced content with proper source attribution |

## Data Collection Points

| Collection Layer       | Captured Content                                  |
|------------------ |-------------------------------------------- |
| Skald Output Logs    | All narrative, language, or user-facing text |
| Media Generation Modules | Images, audio, video content outputs     |
| User Feedback API    | Direct user-submitted bias reports          |
| Agent Skill Outputs  | Any skill-generated culturally themed content |
| Scenario Execution Logs | Cultural references inside workflows       |

## Scoring Models

| Model Type          | Description                                  |
|---------------- |------------------------------------ |
| Static Rule-Based Detection | Keyword and pattern-based filters for known biases |
| ML-Based Bias Detection | Use NLP classifiers for implicit bias detection |
| Cultural Attribution Checker | Cross-check metadata against required attribution fields |
| Representation Equity Scorer | Evaluate balance of cultural group mentions over time |
| Sentiment Divergence Index | Measure sentiment variation across cultural contexts |

---

## Reporting and Dashboards

| Report Type             | Purpose                                      |
|------------------ |----------------------------------------- |
| Cultural Bias Incident Report | Summary of detected bias incidents by timeframe |
| Representation Diversity Scorecard | Track content source balance across regions/cultures |
| Sentiment Bias Heatmap | Visualize areas with sentiment imbalance |
| Cultural Feedback Summary | Aggregate user-submitted feedback on cultural sensitivity |
| Anti-Appropriation Risk Profile | Flag high-risk content categories for review |

## Ethics Integration

- JUNZI-layer filters for **pre-output cultural sensitivity blocking**
- HIEROS audit for **post-output diversity balance analysis**
- Agent-level **Cultural Risk Profiles** used in scheduling and scenario planning

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                        | Purpose                           |
|------ |--------------------------- |----------------------------- |
| POST  | `/culture/scan-output`      | Analyze agent output for sensitivity issues |
| GET   | `/culture/metrics/{node_id}` | Retrieve Node Class-level cultural sensitivity metrics |
| POST  | `/culture/feedback`          | Submit user cultural sensitivity feedback |
| GET   | `/culture/report/weekly`     | Generate weekly cultural sensitivity report |

---

## Extensibility

- External cultural advisor API integrations
- Real-time agent coaching for language and representation choices
- AI-driven automatic cultural tone adjustment for Skald outputs
- Federated cultural metrics aggregation across nodes
