# kOS Skald Node Class Specification

## Overview
The **kOS Skald Node Class** serves as the narrative, communication, and external-facing linguistic intelligence layer of the kOS ecosystem. Skald Nodes orchestrate the entire communication lifecycle: from contextual trigger detection to message generation, translation, formatting, routing, and delivery confirmation.

Skald Nodes act as the "voice and storyteller" of the system—transforming raw ecosystem signals into ethically sound, human-readable, multi-format outputs for users, agents, and external systems.

---

## 1. Primary Roles and Functions

- Contextual trigger management (via GCTE)
- Narrative message generation (via SCMG)
- Audience targeting and routing (via SATRE)
- Multi-language translation and localization (via SLTLE)
- Format conversion for multi-modal output (via SFCMOE)
- Output delivery and confirmation (via SODCS)
- Sentiment and tone management
- Ethical content filtering via GEIG

---

## 2. Standard Agent Types within Skald Nodes

- **Contextual Trigger Agents**
- **Message Generation Agents**
- **Audience Targeting Agents**
- **Translation and Localization Agents**
- **Format Conversion Agents**
- **Delivery Confirmation Agents**
- **Ethical Language Moderators**

---

## 3. Internal Architecture

### 3.1 Skald Pipeline Engine
- Manages sequential flow through all Skald modules (GCTE → SCMG → SATRE → SLTLE → SFCMOE → SODCS)
- Supports asynchronous and batched message workflows

### 3.2 Narrative Context Manager
- Maintains conversation state (where applicable)
- Tracks audience interaction history
- Applies Knowledge Graph context to personalize messages

### 3.3 Ethical Oversight Layer
- Integrates GEIG checks at multiple Skald pipeline stages
- Redacts, rewrites, or blocks unethical content before output

### 3.4 Multi-Modal Output Coordinator
- Synchronizes output across text, audio, visual, and API channels
- Ensures consistent narrative and factual alignment across formats

---

## 4. Audience Types Served

- Human Users (Admins, Operators, End Users)
- External Systems (APIs, Webhooks)
- Internal Agents (Task notifications, status updates)
- Broadcast Recipients (Cluster-wide or global messages)

---

## 5. Ethical and Security Safeguards

- Rate-limiting for outbound communications
- Content masking for sensitive information
- Full audit trail of all generated and delivered messages
- User opt-out controls for non-critical notifications

---

## 6. Performance and Scaling

- Horizontal scaling across Skald Node pools
- Load-aware message queue management
- Caching for frequent standard responses
- Real-time failover for critical system messages

---

## 7. Monitoring and Observability

- Pipeline latency metrics per Skald module
- Delivery success/failure rates
- Message generation error tracking
- Sentiment and tone distribution analytics

---

## 8. Optional Advanced Features

- AI-driven tone adjustment and audience preference learning
- Conversational thread management for chat-based interfaces
- Cross-agent narrative coordination for multi-agent dialogues
- Automatic summarization for long-form system reports

---

## Conclusion
The **kOS Skald Node Class** enables ethically governed, context-rich, and audience-targeted communication across the entire ecosystem—turning raw system events into actionable, informative, and human-meaningful outputs at scale.
