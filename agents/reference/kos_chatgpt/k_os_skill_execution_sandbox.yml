# kOS Skill Execution Sandbox

## Overview
The **kOS Skill Execution Sandbox (SES)** is the runtime isolation environment that securely hosts and executes individual agent skills. Its primary role is to prevent unauthorized resource access, contain faults, enforce runtime limits, and apply ethical constraints on skill execution.

---

## Core Objectives

| Objective                  | Purpose                                         |
|-------------------------- |----------------------------------------------- |
| Runtime Isolation          | Prevent skill-level failures from affecting the parent agent or system |
| Resource Limiting          | Enforce CPU, memory, disk, and network usage caps per skill |
| Security Enforcement       | Block unauthorized system calls, file access, or external network calls |
| Ethical Runtime Filters    | Integrate JUNZI for in-execution ethical checks |
| Fault Containment          | Trap, log, and gracefully recover from skill exceptions |
| Dynamic Skill Loading      | Allow on-demand skill load, unload, and version swaps |

---

## Sandbox Architecture

| Layer                | Description                                  |
|------------------- |------------------------------------------ |
| Execution Container | Process, thread, or VM-based execution wrapper for each skill |
| Resource Governor   | Monitors and enforces runtime resource quotas |
| Permission Controller | Defines allowed system APIs and external calls |
| Ethics Monitor      | Real-time ethical constraint enforcement   |
| Exception Handler   | Captures and logs all skill-level runtime errors |
| Skill Context Loader | Injects relevant agent and system context into the skill before execution |

---

## Supported Execution Models

| Model                  | Description                                   |
|--------------------- |------------------------------------------- |
| Thread-Based          | Lightweight, fast, but limited isolation     |
| Process-Based         | Stronger isolation, moderate resource use    |
| Containerized (Optional) | Full OS-level isolation using Docker, OCI, or Firecracker |
| Virtualized (Optional) | Heavyweight, for high-risk skill execution   |

---

## Runtime Limits (Configurable)

| Resource Type        | Default Limit          |
|------------------- |---------------------- |
| CPU Usage           | 200ms per execution cycle |
| Memory Footprint    | 128MB per skill instance |
| Disk I/O            | 5MB/sec max throughput   |
| Network Calls       | Blocked by default       |
| Execution Time      | 2 seconds per skill call |

---

## Ethical Enforcement Hooks (JUNZI)

| Hook Point           | Purpose                                       |
|-------------------- |------------------------------------------- |
| Pre-Execution Filter | Validate skill against ethical context and constraints before start |
| Mid-Execution Monitor | Live-monitor runtime behavior for violations |
| Post-Execution Audit | Capture and evaluate execution trace for ethics compliance |

---

## Error Handling and Recovery

| Error Type             | System Response                           |
|--------------------- |---------------------------------------- |
| Uncaught Exception    | Log, trigger fallback, notify orchestrator |
| Resource Exhaustion   | Kill skill instance, log, trigger alert   |
| Ethics Violation      | Halt execution, quarantine skill, flag for review |
| Sandbox Breach Attempt | Immediate skill termination, agent quarantine |

---

## Developer API

| Function                 | Purpose                         |
|---------------------- |------------------------------- |
| `load_skill(skill_id)` | Dynamically load skill         |
| `execute_skill(params)` | Run skill with given parameters |
| `unload_skill(skill_id)` | Safely remove skill from runtime |
| `get_skill_status()`    | Check skill execution state    |
| `sandbox_metrics()`     | View resource usage per skill  |

---

## Logging and Metrics

- Execution duration
- Resource consumption per call
- Ethics violations per skill
- Error frequency per skill version

---

## Extensibility

- Support for multiple runtime languages (future phases)
- Pluggable policy engine for custom runtime rules
- Optional AI-driven runtime anomaly detection

---

The **kOS Skill Execution Sandbox** provides a secure, controlled, and ethically aligned environment for all skill execution within the kOS ecosystem.
