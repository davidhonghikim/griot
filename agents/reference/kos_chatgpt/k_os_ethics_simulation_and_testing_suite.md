# kOS Ethics Simulation and Testing Suite

## Overview
The **kOS Ethics Simulation and Testing Suite (ESTS)** is a dedicated framework for validating, stress-testing, and simulating ethical decision flows within the kOS ecosystem. It ensures that agents, nodes, and system workflows remain ethically compliant under both normal and extreme conditions.

## Core Functions

| Function                    | Purpose                                      |
|------------------------ |------------------------------------------ |
| Ethics Stress Testing       | Simulate high volumes of ethically risky actions to test system resilience |
| Scenario-Based Ethics Simulation | Model complex multi-agent workflows with embedded ethical dilemmas |
| Automated Violation Injection | Insert synthetic violations to test filter effectiveness |
| Ethics Regression Testing  | Prevent reintroduction of previously blocked unethical behaviors |
| Consent Flow Simulation     | Verify consent-handling logic under load and edge cases |
| Post-Action Ethics Auditing | Evaluate system performance in identifying and reacting to historical violations |

## Simulation Types

| Simulation Type          | Example Purpose                            |
|-------------------- |------------------------------------ |
| Action Flood Simulation | Overwhelm agents with ethically ambiguous requests |
| Consent Withdrawal Simulation | Test system response when users revoke consent mid-process |
| Delayed Ethics Feedback | Test system behavior when ethics evaluation latency is introduced |
| Cross-Node Ethical Conflict | Simulate contradictory ethics states across federated nodes |
| High Violation Density | Ensure system stability under violation surges |

## Test Suite Components

| Component                | Role                                        |
|-------------------- |-------------------------------------- |
| Ethics Test Scenario Engine | Define and execute ethics-focused test flows |
| Violation Generator      | Programmatically create ethics breach inputs |
| Compliance Metrics Tracker | Measure system block rate, override rate, and filter accuracy |
| Audit Log Verifier       | Ensure all ethical decisions are properly logged |
| Ethics Policy Diff Tool  | Compare pre- and post-deployment ethics rule changes |

---

## Metrics and KPIs

| Metric                    | Purpose                               |
|--------------------- |--------------------------------- |
| Ethics Filter Block Rate | % of unethical actions successfully blocked |
| False Negative Rate    | Rate of unethical actions that slipped through |
| Ethics Filter Latency  | Time taken per ethics decision            |
| Ethics Regression Failure Rate | Count of reappeared old violations |
| Consent Flow Integrity Score | % of scenarios where consent rules were respected |

---

## Developer Responsibilities

| Requirement               | Mandatory For...                         |
|--------------------- |------------------------------------ |
| Ethics Unit Tests        | All modules with decision-making logic |
| Scenario-Based Tests     | Any workflow crossing multiple Node Classes |
| Consent Revocation Tests | Any agent touching user data or profiles |
| Historical Violation Replay | All upgrades affecting ethics filters |

---

## Testing Workflow

1. **Test Scenario Load:** Load YAML or JSON-based ethics test case
2. **Test Execution:** Run simulation through live agents or staging environment
3. **Ethics Evaluation:** Capture JUNZI and HIEROS filter responses
4. **Violation Injection (Optional):** Programmatically introduce known violations
5. **Metrics Collection:** Capture block rates, latency, and decision traces
6. **Result Analysis:** Generate compliance report with pass/fail outcomes

## API and CLI Commands

| Command                   | Purpose                                |
|---------------------- |---------------------------------- |
| `kos ethics-test run --scenario {id}` | Execute predefined ethics test scenario |
| `kos ethics-test inject --violation {type}` | Inject synthetic ethics violation |
| `kos ethics-test report` | Generate ethics testing report        |
| `kos ethics-test diff`   | Compare ethics policy versions       |
| `kos ethics-test benchmark` | Run ethics filter performance benchmark |
