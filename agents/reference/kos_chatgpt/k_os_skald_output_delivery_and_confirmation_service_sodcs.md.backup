# kOS Skald Output Delivery and Confirmation Service (SODCS)

## Overview
The **kOS Skald Output Delivery and Confirmation Service (SODCS)** manages the final stage of the Skald communication pipeline: the physical transmission and delivery confirmation of all generated outputs across various channels. SODCS ensures reliable, trackable, and ethically compliant delivery of Skald messages to their intended recipients.

SODCS also monitors, confirms, and logs receipt, read status, or action acknowledgment where applicable.

---

## 1. Core Responsibilities

- Output dispatch execution
- Delivery status tracking
- Read receipt or action acknowledgment (where supported)
- Retry management for failed deliveries
- Ethical confirmation gating via GEIG

---

## 2. Delivery Channels Managed

- WebSocket Streams
- REST API Webhooks
- Email (SMTP)
- SMS Gateways
- UI Notification Panels
- External Pub/Sub Topics
- LoRa/BLE/RF for off-grid nodes (Optional)

---

## 3. Dispatch Workflow

1. Receives fully packaged and formatted outputs from SFCMOE.
2. Checks delivery readiness (recipient availability, channel status).
3. GEIG re-validation of final delivery parameters.
4. Sends output to selected channel(s).
5. Tracks delivery attempt, success, or failure.
6. Monitors for receipt confirmation or error feedback.

---

## 4. Delivery Confirmation Types

- **Transmission Success:** Confirmation from channel provider (e.g., SMTP server 250 OK)
- **Recipient Receipt:** For APIs or WebSocket clients that acknowledge payloads
- **Read Confirmation:** Where supported (e.g., UI dashboards)
- **Action Taken:** If message requires user/system interaction (e.g., task acknowledgment)

---

## 5. API Endpoints

- `/sodcs/deliver`
- `/sodcs/status/{message_id}`
- `/sodcs/receipt/report`
- `/sodcs/retry/{message_id}`
- `/sodcs/channel/health`
- `/sodcs/logs`

---

## 6. Failure and Retry Logic

- Configurable retry intervals and limits
- Exponential backoff for transient failures
- Escalation to human operator if delivery repeatedly fails
- Optional failover to secondary channels (as determined by SATRE)

---

## 7. Ethical Safeguards

- GEIG check before final dispatch (to prevent late-stage ethical violations)
- Delivery suppression if recipient context changes mid-pipeline
- Audit trail for all delivery attempts and outcomes
- Data masking for sensitive delivery logs

---

## 8. Performance and Scaling

- Asynchronous dispatch queues for high-throughput delivery
- Horizontal scaling of dispatch worker nodes
- Persistent message tracking database
- Real-time monitoring dashboards

---

## 9. Advanced Features

- AI-driven delivery success prediction scoring
- Adaptive retry scheduling based on historical success rates
- Delivery load balancing across redundant channel endpoints
- Pluggable third-party notification services

---

## Conclusion
The **kOS Skald Output Delivery and Confirmation Service (SODCS)** ensures that every Skald-generated communication is delivered reliably, ethically, and verifiably—closing the final loop in the Skald message lifecycle across the kOS ecosystem.

✅ This completes the **Skald Class Module Specifications** for Phase 8.
