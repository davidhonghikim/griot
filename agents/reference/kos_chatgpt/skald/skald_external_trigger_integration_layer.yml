# Skald Module Specification: External Trigger Integration Layer (ETI)

## Module Name
**Skald External Trigger Integration Layer (ETI)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Skald External Trigger Integration Layer (ETI) allows Skald to receive, process, and react to external events and triggers from third-party systems, services, IoT devices, webhooks, and partner applications. ETI bridges external systems with the Skald runtime workflow engine.

## Purpose
To enable Skald workflows and modules to be activated, modified, or controlled in real time by external systems, expanding interoperability and responsiveness.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Trigger Source Support
- **HTTP Webhooks:** Accept JSON payloads via REST endpoints.
- **Message Queues:** Integrate with RabbitMQ, Kafka, or other message brokers.
- **IoT Device Streams:** Support MQTT or custom protocol adapters.
- **File System Events:** React to file creation, updates, or deletion in monitored directories.
- **Custom Plugins:** Allow developer-defined external trigger sources.

### 2. Trigger Parsing and Normalization
- **Payload Normalization:** Convert varied input formats into a unified internal event schema.
- **Event Filtering:** Apply rule-based filtering to decide which triggers warrant action.
- **Input Validation:** Ensure external trigger payloads meet expected schema definitions.

### 3. Trigger-to-Workflow Mapping
- **Event-to-Workflow Binding:** Map incoming trigger types to specific Skald workflows.
- **Dynamic Binding Support:** Allow runtime configuration of trigger-workflow mappings.
- **Multi-Trigger Routing:** Allow single triggers to activate multiple workflows.

### 4. Security and Authentication
- **Source Verification:** Validate external trigger sources (API keys, signatures, IP whitelisting).
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevent abuse from overly chatty or malicious trigger sources.
- **Replay Protection:** Prevent duplicate trigger processing.

### 5. Observability and Logging
- **Trigger Logs:** Record all received triggers with source, timestamp, and processing outcome.
- **Failure Alerts:** Notify admins on failed trigger parsing or mapping.
- **Metrics Collection:** Track trigger volume, latency, and error rates.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Latency:** Sub-100ms trigger ingestion time.
- **Scalability:** Support millions of triggers per day.
- **Reliability:** Guarantee trigger delivery and processing order where applicable.
- **Extensibility:** Allow plugin-based adapters for new trigger types.

## Data Flow Diagram (Textual)
1. **External Event Source** → 2. **Trigger Listener (HTTP, MQ, IoT, etc.)** → 3. **Payload Normalizer** → 4. **Trigger Filter/Validator** → 5. **Trigger-to-Workflow Mapper** → 6. **Skald Workflow Orchestrator (SWO)**

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** Webhooks, Message Queues, IoT Gateways, File System Watchers.
- **Output Interfaces:** Skald Workflow Orchestrator, Event Bus, Logging Systems.

## Configuration Options
- **Trigger Source Registry:** Enable/disable specific trigger sources.
- **Authentication Methods:** API key, HMAC signature, OAuth token, etc.
- **Rate Limit Settings:** Per source or global.
- **Payload Schema Definitions:** Custom per trigger type.

## Example Use Cases
- Triggering a Skald translation workflow from a Slack webhook.
- Activating narrative generation based on IoT sensor data.
- Launching summary generation from a Kafka event stream.
- Running sentiment analysis on incoming social media feed data.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **Custom Trigger Adapters:** For unsupported external systems.
- **Third-Party API Connector Plugins:** Directly consume partner APIs as triggers.
- **Dynamic Mapping API:** Allow runtime changes to trigger-workflow mappings.

## Testing and Validation Plan
- Trigger ingestion stress tests.
- Source authentication tests.
- Trigger mapping correctness tests.
- Failure recovery validation.

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **Skald Workflow Orchestrator (SWO)**
- **Skald API Gateway (SAG)**
- **Skald Error Handling Engine (EHR)**

## Future Enhancements
- Event correlation across multiple trigger sources.
- AI-based trigger relevance scoring.
- Time-window-based event aggregation triggers.
- GUI-based trigger mapping interface.
