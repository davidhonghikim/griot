# Skald Module Specification: Historical Analytics and Trends Visualizer (HATV)

## Module Name
**Skald Historical Analytics and Trends Visualizer (HATV)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Skald Historical Analytics and Trends Visualizer (HATV) enables administrators and analysts to perform retrospective analysis, long-term trend visualization, and system-wide historical reporting across Skald modules. It surfaces patterns, performance changes, error trends, user behavior shifts, and workflow execution histories over extended timeframes.

## Purpose
To support decision-making, capacity planning, SLA evaluation, model retraining, and business reporting by providing time-aggregated, customizable views of Skald system activity and historical performance data.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Time-Series Data Aggregation
- **Multi-Source Metrics Aggregator:** Pull historical data from LTMS, HEARS, WOQEE, SQL, and other modules.
- **Long-Term Trend Rollups:** Provide day/week/month/year aggregation options.
- **Cross-Metric Correlation:** Allow side-by-side comparison of multiple metrics (e.g., latency vs. error rate vs. user load).

### 2. Customizable Trend Visualizations
- **Time-Series Graphs:** Display trends like SLA breach rates, average workflow duration, resource utilization, and output quality over time.
- **Heatmaps:** Visualize anomaly concentrations by time and module.
- **Histogram and Distribution Charts:** For metrics like latency, error types, or quality scores.

### 3. Comparative Analytics Tools
- **Period Comparison Mode:** Compare current period vs. previous (week-over-week, month-over-month).
- **Before/After Change Analysis:** Highlight performance shifts after config changes, deployments, or policy updates.
- **Trend Anomaly Detection:** Flag statistically significant deviations.

### 4. Report Generation and Export
- **Scheduled Report Generator:** Produce daily/weekly/monthly trend reports.
- **Ad-Hoc Report Builder:** Allow custom user-defined report creation.
- **Export Options:** CSV, JSON, PDF for internal review or external audit.

### 5. Forecasting and Capacity Planning Support
- **Predictive Trend Lines:** Display future metric projections using historical data models.
- **Capacity Forecast Dashboards:** Show future resource needs based on usage growth trends.
- **Growth Hotspot Detection:** Identify workflows or modules showing unsustainable growth rates.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Query Latency:** Sub-2s for standard trend queries on year-long datasets.
- **Scalability:** Handle multi-year, petabyte-scale historical data sets.
- **Extensibility:** Support new metric types and data sources over time.
- **Visualization Performance:** Smooth rendering for charts with >10k data points.

## Data Flow Diagram (Textual)

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** Long-Term Telemetry and Metrics Store (LTMS), Historical Execution Archive (HEARS), Workflow Output Quality Engine (WOQEE), SLA Enforcement Layer (SQL).
- **Output Interfaces:** Admin Dashboard (DVL), External Reporting Tools, Storage Export Modules.

## Configuration Options
- **Aggregation Granularity:** Hourly / Daily / Weekly / Monthly.
- **Visualization Themes:** Light / Dark / Custom.
- **Export Scheduling:** Time-based or trigger-based.
- **Forecasting Models:** Linear / Exponential / AI-based.

## Example Use Cases
- Identifying rising error rates over a 6-month window.
- Comparing SLA compliance before and after a system upgrade.
- Forecasting storage needs for the next quarter.
- Generating a quarterly executive report on Skald system performance.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **Custom Metric Import API:** Allow new data sources for historical analysis.
- **External BI Tool Connectors:** Push reports to external data warehouses.
- **Custom Forecast Model Plugins:** For organization-specific prediction logic.

## Testing and Validation Plan
- Trend aggregation accuracy tests.
- Forecast projection validation against known test data.
- Visualization rendering stress tests.
- Export report formatting and delivery tests.

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **Long-Term Telemetry and Metrics Store (LTMS)**
- **Historical Execution Archive (HEARS)**
- **Workflow Output Quality Evaluation Engine (WOQEE)**
- **SLA Enforcement Layer (SQL)**

## Future Enhancements
- AI-based anomaly trend discovery.
- Interactive data drill-down interfaces.
- Natural language trend query support.
- Multi-tenant trend segmentation views.
