# Skald Module Specification: Conversational Memory Manager (CMM)

## Module Name
**Conversational Memory Manager (CMM)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Conversational Memory Manager (CMM) is the Skald submodule responsible for tracking, storing, retrieving, and managing conversation histories and contextual memory for ongoing interactions. It enables Skald agents to maintain long-term coherence, continuity, and personalization across user sessions and multi-turn dialogues.

## Purpose
To provide memory persistence and retrieval functions that support context-aware storytelling, user personalization, follow-up continuity, and historical reference tracking within all Skald conversational processes.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Memory Types
- **Short-Term (Session) Memory:** Tracks current conversation turn context.
- **Medium-Term Memory:** Retains contextual threads across sessions (e.g., conversation topic continuity).
- **Long-Term Memory:** Persistent storage of key facts, user preferences, past interactions, and emotional history.
- **Ephemeral Memory:** Temporary, discardable buffers for volatile context.

### 2. Memory Storage
- **On-Disk Persistent Storage:** For long-term memory (e.g., SQLite, JSON, NoSQL, etc.).
- **In-Memory Cache:** For low-latency retrieval during active sessions.
- **Encrypted Storage:** Optional encryption for sensitive user data.

### 3. Context Management
- **Conversation Thread Tracking:** Maintain reference pointers for multi-threaded chats.
- **Topic Segmentation:** Automatically segment and label conversation topics.
- **Speaker Identification:** Track and differentiate multi-user conversation streams.
- **Temporal Context Awareness:** Timestamp tagging for all memory entries.

### 4. Retrieval and Injection
- **Contextual Retrieval:** Surface relevant past memories dynamically during response generation.
- **Searchable Memory Index:** Enable keyword, semantic, or intent-based searches across stored memories.
- **Memory Pruning:** Implement aging and relevance-based pruning strategies.
- **User-Controlled Memory Access:** Allow users to review, edit, or delete stored memories.

### 5. Personalization Layer
- **User Profiles:** Store user-specific preferences, likes/dislikes, frequently asked topics.
- **Emotional Memory:** Track historical sentiment trends per user.
- **Interaction History Summaries:** Summarize past interactions for fast context refresh.

### 6. Security and Privacy
- **GDPR/CCPA Compliance Features:** Support data export, anonymization, and deletion on request.
- **Access Control:** Memory retrieval restricted to authenticated Skald agents.
- **Encryption in Transit and At Rest:** Protect stored memory data.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Latency:** <50ms for short-term memory retrieval.
- **Scalability:** Handle thousands of concurrent active sessions.
- **Data Integrity:** Safeguard against memory corruption or loss.
- **Extensibility:** Modular memory storage backend (switchable between file-based, DB, etc.).

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** Skald Workflow Engine, User Interaction Logger.
- **Output Interfaces:** Skald Narrative Generator, Sentiment Engine, Personality Engine.

## Configuration Options
- **Memory Retention Periods:** (Short-term: Minutes/Hours, Long-term: Days/Indefinite)
- **Pruning Strategy:** (LRU, Time-based, Relevance-based)
- **Encryption Mode:** (On/Off)
- **Max Memory Size Per User:** (Configurable)

## Example Use Cases
- Remembering user preferences between sessions.
- Referencing prior conversation points in follow-up dialogue.
- Maintaining emotional consistency across long support chats.
- Summarizing past interactions for quick re-engagement.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **Custom Memory Backends:** Support for different storage systems (SQL, NoSQL, Graph DB).
- **User Feedback Correction Loop:** Allow memory correction via user input.
- **Federated Memory Sync:** Sync memory across distributed Skald nodes.

## Testing and Validation Plan
- Load testing with thousands of concurrent user sessions.
- Accuracy testing of memory retrieval logic.
- Latency benchmarking.
- Security audit for data privacy compliance.

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **Skald NLP Engine**
- **Skald Workflow Dispatcher**
- **Persistent Storage System (Local or Cloud)**

## Future Enhancements
- Vectorized semantic memory storage for faster relevance search.
- Memory graph visualization dashboard.
- User-controlled memory training feedback loop.
- Real-time multi-agent memory synchronization.
