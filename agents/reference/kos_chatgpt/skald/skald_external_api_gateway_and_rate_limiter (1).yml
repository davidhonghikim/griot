# Skald Module Specification: External API Gateway and Rate Limiter (EAGRL)

## Module Name
**Skald External API Gateway and Rate Limiter (EAGRL)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Skald External API Gateway and Rate Limiter (EAGRL) acts as the primary ingress and traffic management layer for all external API calls into the Skald system. EAGRL provides secure API endpoint exposure, rate limiting, authentication, request routing, traffic shaping, and API usage monitoring.

## Purpose
To safely and efficiently manage external client access to Skald services while preventing abuse, ensuring performance SLAs, and enforcing authentication, authorization, and throttling policies.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. API Traffic Management
- **API Gateway Routing:** Route incoming API calls to appropriate Skald modules (DAEEL, WEM, MTVE, etc.).
- **Load Balancing:** Distribute requests across Skald backend nodes.
- **Request Queuing and Throttling:** Smooth out traffic spikes and prevent backend saturation.

### 2. Authentication and Authorization
- **API Key Management:** Support API key-based authentication.
- **OAuth2 and JWT Support:** Allow token-based authentication for federated identity systems.
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Enforce per-endpoint access policies.
- **Multi-Tenant Isolation:** Separate rate limits and API entitlements by tenant.

### 3. Rate Limiting and Quota Enforcement
- **Per-User and Per-Endpoint Rate Limits:** Allow fine-grained throttling.
- **Burst Rate Controls:** Allow short-term burst traffic within defined limits.
- **Quota Enforcement:** Define daily, weekly, or monthly request quotas.
- **Exceedance Handling:** Provide 429 Too Many Requests responses with retry-after headers.

### 4. API Monitoring and Analytics
- **Request Logging:** Log all incoming API requests for audit and analytics purposes.
- **Traffic Metrics Dashboard:** Display API call rates, error rates, latency distributions.
- **Abuse Detection Hooks:** Alert admins on suspicious API usage patterns.

### 5. Security Features
- **IP Whitelisting/Blacklisting:** Allow or deny traffic from specific IP ranges.
- **Rate Limiting by Source IP:** Prevent distributed API abuse.
- **TLS Termination:** Support HTTPS for all external API traffic.
- **Header and Payload Inspection:** Enforce schema compliance and block malformed requests.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Low Latency:** Sub-100ms gateway processing overhead per request.
- **High Throughput:** Support tens of thousands of API calls per second.
- **Resilience:** Remain operational during backend outages (with graceful degradation).
- **Extensibility:** Support pluggable authentication backends and rate limiting algorithms.

## Data Flow Diagram (Textual)
1. **External API Call → EAGRL Authenticator → Rate Limiter → Request Router → Target Skald Module → Response → External Client**

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** External API Clients.
- **Output Interfaces:** Skald Internal API Layers (DAEEL, WEM, MTVE, etc.), Audit Logging (CALE), Metrics and Telemetry Systems (MTVE).

## Configuration Options
- **Rate Limit Policies:** Per endpoint, per user, per tenant.
- **Authentication Modes:** API Key / OAuth2 / JWT / Custom.
- **Quota Periods:** Daily / Weekly / Monthly.
- **Request Size Limits:** Configurable maximum payload size.

## Example Use Cases
- Exposing workflow execution status APIs to external clients.
- Throttling large partner API consumers during peak hours.
- Blocking abusive IPs making excessive failed API calls.
- Enforcing per-customer API usage quotas for paid service tiers.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **Custom Authenticator Plugin API:** Support custom authentication schemes.
- **Dynamic Rate Policy Loader:** Allow runtime updates to rate limiting rules.
- **External Monitoring System Connectors:** Push API metrics to external dashboards.

## Testing and Validation Plan
- Rate limiting accuracy tests.
- Authentication flow validation (API Key, OAuth2, JWT).
- Load testing for high-throughput scenarios.
- Security vulnerability scanning (e.g., API injection attempts).

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **Audit Logging and Compliance Engine (ALC)**
- **Metrics and Telemetry Visualization Engine (MTVE)**
- **Dashboard API and External Export Layer (DAEEL)**

## Future Enhancements
- AI-driven API traffic anomaly detection.
- Geo-based API traffic shaping.
- Dynamic user-specific throttling based on usage behavior.
- GraphQL API support for external clients.
