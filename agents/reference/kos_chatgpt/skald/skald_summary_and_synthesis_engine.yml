# Skald Module Specification: Summary and Synthesis Engine (SSE)

## Module Name
**Summary and Synthesis Engine (SSE)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Summary and Synthesis Engine (SSE) is the Skald submodule responsible for condensing, abstracting, and synthesizing information from diverse input sources into coherent, context-aware, and audience-tailored summaries. The SSE handles both extractive and abstractive summarization modes and can also synthesize new content from multiple sources.

## Purpose
To reduce information overload and provide condensed, actionable, or high-level overviews of large content bodies, complex datasets, ongoing conversations, and real-time system states for both human and machine consumers.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Input Types
- **Text Documents:** Articles, reports, logs, conversations.
- **Multi-Document Inputs:** Synthesize across multiple sources.
- **Live Stream Data:** Summarize ongoing chat threads or event streams.
- **Code Blocks:** Summarize source code changes or pull request contents.

### 2. Summarization Modes
- **Extractive Summarization:** Select key sentences or sections verbatim.
- **Abstractive Summarization:** Generate new text conveying the key ideas in original language.
- **Hybrid Mode:** Combine both extractive and abstractive techniques.
- **Bullet Point Mode:** Create list-style summaries for quick reading.

### 3. Synthesis Capabilities
- **Cross-Source Synthesis:** Combine content from multiple documents or channels into a unified summary.
- **Context-Aware Theming:** Adjust summaries for different audiences (e.g., technical, executive, casual reader).
- **Custom Length Targets:** Ability to generate 1-line, 1-paragraph, or multi-paragraph summaries based on request.
- **Sentiment/Emotion Overlay:** Annotate summaries with detected tone or sentiment markers if desired.

### 4. AI and ML Integration
- **Transformer-Based Summarization Models:** Integration with state-of-the-art NLP models.
- **Topic Detection:** Auto-detect dominant topics for thematic summaries.
- **User Feedback Adaptation:** Learn from user ratings and corrections.

### 5. Output Formats
- **Plain Text**
- **Markdown**
- **HTML**
- **JSON (for structured programmatic consumption)**
- **Voice-ready Text (optimized for TTS modules)**

### 6. Real-Time and Batch Modes
- **Real-Time Streaming Summaries:** For live chats or system logs.
- **Scheduled Batch Summaries:** For daily reports, logs, or periodic digests.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Latency:** Under 500ms for small to medium inputs (<5k words).
- **Scalability:** Support summarization of large datasets (>10MB text).
- **Robustness:** Graceful handling of malformed or incomplete inputs.
- **Configurable Summarization Levels:** High-level vs. detailed summaries.

## Data Flow Diagram (Textual)
1. **Input Data Source(s)** → 2. **Preprocessor** → 3. **Topic Detector (optional)** → 4. **Summarization Model (extractive/abstractive/hybrid)** → 5. **Post-Processor/Formatter** → 6. **Output Channel**

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** REST API, Web UI, CLI, kOS Event Bus, file drop.
- **Output Interfaces:** API response, notification system, Skald Workflow Output Bus, text-to-speech module.

## Configuration Options
- **Summary Length Target:** (Short, Medium, Long)
- **Summarization Mode:** (Extractive, Abstractive, Hybrid)
- **Topic Sensitivity Level:** (High/Medium/Low)
- **Output Format Selection:** (Text/Markdown/JSON/etc.)

## Example Use Cases
- Executive summaries of long technical documents.
- Condensing live chat support sessions into case summaries.
- Synthesizing multi-source threat reports into a single actionable alert.
- Summarizing pull request changes for developer reviews.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **Custom Summarization Models:** Allow pluggable models for different industries or languages.
- **Sentiment Plugins:** Integrate emotional tone detectors.
- **Custom Post-Processors:** Support additional output transformations like bullet-point formatting or infographic generation.

## Testing and Validation Plan
- Benchmark tests on standard summarization datasets.
- Real-world scenario tests using user-provided documents.
- Latency and throughput load testing.
- Output quality evaluations via human reviewers.

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **Skald NLP Engine**
- **Transformer-based Summarization Models (local or API-based)**
- **Voice Synthesis Module (optional for voice output)**

## Future Enhancements
- Interactive summarization refinement via user chat interface.
- Multi-modal summarization (e.g., summarizing video/audio content).
- AI-guided summary length optimization based on audience profile.
- Visual summary outputs (graphs, charts, infographic summaries).
