# Skald Module Specification: Translation Engine (TE)

## Module Name
**Translation Engine (TE)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Translation Engine (TE) is a Skald submodule responsible for performing real-time and batch translations across any known human, machine, symbolic, or emerging languages. This module handles linguistic conversion while preserving semantic, emotional, cultural, and contextual integrity. It supports text, voice, symbolic, or code-based inputs and outputs.

## Purpose
To enable universal communication and seamless translation between any agents, users, devices, or external systems, regardless of language or symbolic system used.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Multi-Language Support
- **Human Languages:** Support for all major and minor world languages.
- **Machine Languages:** Translation between programming languages, markup languages, protocol descriptions, etc.
- **Symbolic Systems:** Support for emojis, mathematical notation, chemical formulas, and emerging user-defined symbol sets.
- **Custom Languages:** Support for newly created or user-defined languages.

### 2. Input Types
- **Text Translation:** Standard text input from user, file, or API.
- **Voice Input:** Real-time speech-to-text translation pipeline.
- **Code Input:** Source code, markup, or data structure translations.
- **Symbol Stream Input:** Emoji sequences, chemical structures, etc.

### 3. Context Preservation
- **Semantic Consistency:** Maintain original meaning.
- **Emotional Tone Preservation:** Retain sentiment, mood, and intention.
- **Cultural Adaptation:** Adjust phrasing or idioms to fit target audience norms.
- **Formatting Retention:** Preserve layout, line breaks, punctuation, and other formatting as needed.

### 4. Multi-Modal Output
- **Plain Text Output**
- **Formatted Document Output (HTML, PDF, Markdown, etc.)**
- **Voice Output (via Skald Voice Synthesis)**
- **Code Output (Syntax-translated for target language)**

### 5. Processing Modes
- **Real-Time Translation:** Low-latency streaming translation.
- **Batch Translation:** Bulk translation of large datasets or documents.
- **Interactive Session Mode:** Conversational translation with dynamic context tracking.

### 6. AI & ML Integration
- **Neural Machine Translation Models (NMT):** Integrated with customizable, locally hosted, or API-accessible NMT models.
- **Few-Shot Learning Interface:** Adapt to new languages or symbols with minimal training samples.
- **User Feedback Loop:** Incremental improvement based on correction feedback.

### 7. Security and Privacy
- **On-Device Translation Support:** Optional full local processing with no external API calls.
- **Data Sanitization:** Automatic removal of sensitive or personal information during translation workflows.
- **Encryption in Transit and Storage:** For sensitive translations.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Latency:** <200ms for real-time translations.
- **Scalability:** Able to process large document batches (>1GB text corpus).
- **Fault Tolerance:** Retry and fallback mechanisms if primary model fails.
- **Extensibility:** Plugin framework for adding new translation engines or models.

## Data Flow Diagram (Textual)
1. **Input Source (Text/Voice/API/Code)** → 2. **Input Preprocessor** → 3. **Language Detector** → 4. **Contextual Analyzer** → 5. **NMT Engine / Rule-based Engine** → 6. **Output Formatter** → 7. **Output Channel**

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** REST API, CLI, Web UI, Message Queue.
- **Output Interfaces:** API response, File Writer, Message Broker, Text-to-Speech module.

## Configuration Options
- **Preferred Target Languages**
- **Model Selection (NMT, Rule-based, Hybrid)**
- **Input/Output Format Mapping**
- **Contextual Sensitivity Level (Low/Medium/High)**
- **Batch Size Limitations**

## Example Use Cases
- Real-time multilingual chat translation.
- Translating system error logs from machine code descriptions to natural language for debugging.
- Converting markdown blog posts into multiple target languages for global publication.
- Translating source code from Python to JavaScript for cross-platform deployments.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **Custom Language Packs:** Developers can add new languages or dialects.
- **Third-Party API Connectors:** Support for external translation APIs like Google Translate, DeepL, or Azure Translator.
- **Model Injection:** Plug in custom-trained ML models.
- **Post-Processing Plugins:** For adjusting tone, humor level, or formality after translation.

## Testing and Validation Plan
- Unit tests for each input and output format.
- Translation accuracy benchmarking using standard corpora.
- Load and stress tests with large batch jobs.
- Latency tests for real-time pipelines.
- Privacy and security audits.

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **Skald Contextual Trigger Engine**
- **NLP Engine (Shared with other Skald modules)**
- **Voice Synthesis Module (optional for voice output)**

## Future Enhancements
- Cross-modal translation (e.g., image-to-text, video subtitling).
- Sentiment-aware translation.
- Humor-tone adjustment sliders for informal translations.
- Decentralized translation model training using federated learning.
