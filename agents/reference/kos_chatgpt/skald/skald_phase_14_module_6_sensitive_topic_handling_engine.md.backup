# Skald Phase 14 - Module 6: Sensitive Topic Handling Engine (STHE)

## Node Class: Skald (Communication & Expression)

## Phase 14 Focus:
Real-Time Detection and Ethical Management of Sensitive Topics

---

## 1. Module Overview
The **Sensitive Topic Handling Engine (STHE)** is designed to detect, classify, and manage content involving sensitive, controversial, or emotionally charged topics in real time. It empowers Skald agents to generate content that addresses sensitive issues responsibly, contextually, and ethicallyâ€”without unnecessary avoidance or unintentional harm.

STHE works in close coordination with **GEPDE**, **CASF**, **CCE**, and **ETLAE**, applying fine-grained topic classification and risk evaluation mechanisms.

## 2. Primary Functions

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Sensitive Topic Classifier** | Uses topic modeling and keyword detection to identify sensitive subject matter (violence, trauma, discrimination, political conflict, etc). |
| **Contextual Risk Scoring Engine** | Evaluates topic sensitivity based on audience profile, jurisdiction, communication intent, and ethical policy context. |
| **Topic-Specific Content Framing Layer** | Adjusts narrative framing, tone, and factual presentation style based on topic sensitivity score and ethical guidelines. |
| **Alternative Phrasing Engine** | Suggests safer or more neutral wording for highly sensitive sections. |
| **Disclaimers and Content Warnings Generator** | Automatically inserts audience-appropriate content warnings where needed. |
| **Multi-Agent Review Trigger System** | Flags extreme-risk content for human or quorum-based agent review before output delivery. |
| **Audit Annotation and Tagging Layer** | Marks sensitive topic decisions and mitigation actions in system audit logs. |
| **User-Configurable Topic Sensitivity Profiles** | Where allowed, users or organizations can configure sensitivity thresholds for specific topics. |

## 3. Data Inputs

| Input | Source |
| --- | --- |
| **Draft Content** | From Skald Story Assembly Engine or upstream modules |
| **Audience Sensitivity Data** | From CASF and Contextual Trigger Engine |
| **Jurisdictional Sensitivity Policies** | From GEPDE and regional policy packs |
| **Topic Sensitivity Framework** | From global or organizational sensitivity libraries |

---

## 4. Data Outputs

| Output | Destination |
| --- | --- |
| **Topic-Risk Scored Content Draft** | Forwarded downstream for final GEPDE ethics check |
| **Content Warning Metadata Tags** | Included for downstream rendering or user notification systems |
| **Escalation Flags (If Applicable)** | Sent to Human Review Layer or multi-agent review queue |
| **Audit Trail Annotations** | Sent to kOS Global Audit Layer |

---

## 5. Processing Pipeline

1. Scan content for sensitive topic triggers
2. Classify topics by category and jurisdictional risk
3. Evaluate audience, ethical framework, and deployment context
4. Adjust language and framing if needed
5. Generate content warnings or disclaimers as necessary
6. Tag output with topic sensitivity metadata
7. Forward to GEPDE for ethics validation

---

## 6. Sensitive Topic Categories (Sample)

| Category | Example Topics |
| --- | --- |
| **Violence** | War, abuse, crime, terrorism |
| **Trauma** | Suicide, PTSD, grief, mental health crises |
| **Discrimination** | Racism, sexism, homophobia, ableism |
| **Political Controversy** | Elections, protests, governance disputes |
| **Health Crises** | Pandemics, terminal illness, disability |
| **Religion and Belief Systems** | Religious conflicts, doctrinal criticism |
| **Historical Atrocities** | Genocide, colonialism, slavery |

---

## 7. Deployment Options

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Default Sensitivity Profiles** | Balanced, Conservative, or Liberal topic sensitivity presets |
| **Custom Organization Topic Filters** | Enterprises can upload specific topic risk guidelines |
| **User-Specific Topic Controls** | Allow end users to set personal topic filter preferences (where permitted) |
| **Jurisdictional Topic Compliance Packs** | Apply region-specific topic handling rules |

---

## 8. Governance Hooks

- Sensitive topic drift detection algorithms
- Multi-agent or human review for high-risk content
- Periodic topic sensitivity framework updates
- Audit logs for all sensitive topic detections and actions

---

## 9. Example Use Case Scenarios

| Scenario | STHE Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Mental health support chatbot discussing depression** | Insert content warnings, soften tone, offer helpline resources |
| **News summary generator covering violent protests** | Frame content factually, include disclaimers, balance perspective |
| **Educational agent teaching history of slavery** | Add audience-appropriate framing and content warnings |
| **Corporate communication addressing sensitive layoffs** | Use supportive tone, avoid triggering phrases, include support resources |
| **User requests unfiltered political commentary** | Escalate for review or apply organization policy-defined limits |

## 10. Module Integration Points

| Module | Integration |
| --- | --- |
| **CASF** | Supplies audience sensitivity thresholds |
| **ETLAE** | Receives tone adjustment guidance based on topic sensitivity |
| **GEPDE** | Validates final topic-handled content for ethics compliance |
| **kOS Global Audit Layer** | Logs all sensitive topic handling decisions |
