# Skald Module Specification: AI-Guided Configuration Tuning Module (AICT)

## Module Name
**Skald AI-Guided Configuration Tuning Module (AICT)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Skald AI-Guided Configuration Tuning Module (AICT) continuously analyzes system telemetry, workflow performance data, and user behavior trends to recommend or automatically apply optimal system configuration adjustments for performance, reliability, and cost efficiency.

## Purpose
To assist administrators and runtime systems by providing AI-generated configuration tuning recommendations or direct auto-tuning actions across Skald modules, with the goal of continuously optimizing runtime parameters based on real-world operational data.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Data Collection and Analysis
- **Config Effectiveness Monitoring:** Track the impact of configuration parameters on system performance and workflow outcomes.
- **Historical Trend Analysis:** Examine multi-week and multi-month config-performance correlations.
- **Real-Time Signal Processing:** Analyze incoming telemetry for immediate tuning opportunities.

### 2. AI-Based Configuration Recommendation Engine
- **Parameter Impact Models:** Train models to estimate how config changes affect key performance indicators (KPIs).
- **What-If Simulations:** Allow simulated analysis of hypothetical config changes.
- **Auto-Generated Tuning Suggestions:** Provide recommended parameter values with justification.
- **Multi-Objective Optimization:** Support tuning for performance, cost, or reliability goals.

### 3. Auto-Tuning Execution Engine
- **Admin Approval Gates:** Allow admins to manually approve or reject recommendations.
- **Safe Mode:** Recommendation-only mode for high-risk deployments.
- **Full Auto-Tune Mode:** Automatically apply low-risk, high-confidence configuration changes.
- **Rollback Support:** Maintain rollback points for all auto-tuned config changes.

### 4. Configuration Deployment and Rollback
- **Versioned Config Updates:** Store and track all configuration changes with timestamps and reasons.
- **Rollback Triggering:** Allow automated rollback in case of performance degradation.
- **Change Notification Hooks:** Notify stakeholders about config changes via email, dashboard, or API.

### 5. Reporting and Dashboards
- **Tuning Action Logs:** Log all AI-generated recommendations and applied changes.
- **Impact Analytics:** Display before-and-after KPI comparisons.
- **Trend Visualization:** Chart config effectiveness over time.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Latency:** Tuning decision cycles must complete within 500ms.
- **Scalability:** Support analysis and tuning across hundreds of modules and thousands of config parameters.
- **Extensibility:** Pluggable AI models and policy engines.
- **Resilience:** Fail-safe default configurations during AICT outages.

## Data Flow Diagram (Textual)

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** Usage Metrics (UMAC), Resource Utilization Monitor (RUM), Admin Control Panel (ACP), Workflow Performance Data (WPOE).
- **Output Interfaces:** Configuration and Policy Management Layer (CPM), Dashboard and Visualization Layer (DVL), Notification Systems.

## Configuration Options
- **Tuning Mode:** Off / Recommend Only / Auto-Tune.
- **Approval Workflow:** Manual / Auto.
- **Impact Thresholds:** Define minimum impact levels required before triggering changes.
- **Tuning Frequency:** Per hour / daily / on-demand.

## Example Use Cases
- Recommending higher thread pool sizes during peak load periods.
- Automatically reducing memory reservation for underutilized modules.
- Suggesting longer timeouts for workflows with consistent near-timeout failures.
- Rolling back a recent tuning that caused a drop in system throughput.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **Custom Tuning Policies:** Allow enterprise-specific config goal setting.
- **External AI Model Integration:** Support 3rd party AI engines for config tuning.
- **Dynamic Objective Profiles:** Allow runtime updates to optimization targets.

## Testing and Validation Plan
- AI recommendation accuracy benchmarking.
- Rollback mechanism validation.
- Admin approval flow tests.
- Simulation vs. production impact comparison tests.

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **Configuration and Policy Management Layer (CPM)**
- **Resource Utilization Monitor (RUM)**
- **Usage Metrics and Analytics Collector (UMAC)**
- **Admin Control Panel (ACP)**

## Future Enhancements
- Reinforcement learning-based config tuning.
- SLA-driven auto-tuning policies.
- AI-based risk scoring for configuration changes.
- AICT training mode for offline learning.
