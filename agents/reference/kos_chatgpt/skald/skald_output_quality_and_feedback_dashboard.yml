# Skald Module Specification: Output Quality and Feedback Dashboard (OQFD)

## Module Name
**Skald Output Quality and Feedback Dashboard (OQFD)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Skald Output Quality and Feedback Dashboard (OQFD) centralizes visualization, monitoring, and management of Skald workflow output quality metrics and user feedback data. It surfaces trends, score distributions, failure patterns, and qualitative user assessments for all generated outputs.

## Purpose
To provide Skald administrators and quality assurance teams with actionable insights into the quality and performance of Skald-generated outputs, enabling optimization, fine-tuning, and SLA compliance monitoring for deliverable quality.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Quality Metrics Visualization
- **Output Quality Score Distribution:** Display real-time and historical quality score histograms across workflows.
- **Trend Analysis:** Graph quality trends over time (average scores, pass/fail rates, compliance rates).
- **Low-Quality Outlier Detection:** Highlight outputs falling below configured quality thresholds.

### 2. Feedback Aggregation and Display
- **User Feedback Timeline:** Show recent user feedback ratings, comments, and categories (accuracy, coherence, style, etc.).
- **Feedback Volume Tracking:** Display counts and percentages of rated outputs vs. unrated.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Run NLP-based sentiment detection on free-text user comments.

### 3. Output Sampling and Inspection
- **Random Sample Browser:** View a random sample of recent outputs for spot-check review.
- **Low-Score Sample Export:** Export low-scoring outputs for external review or retraining datasets.
- **Feedback-Driven Output Lookup:** Search outputs by feedback rating or comment content.

### 4. SLA and Compliance Monitoring
- **Quality SLA Compliance Graphs:** Track percentage of outputs meeting defined quality SLAs.
- **Non-Compliance Alerts:** Notify admins when rolling quality averages fall below SLA targets.
- **SLA Violation Drill-Down:** Allow detailed inspection of violating outputs.

### 5. Optimization Feedback Loop Integration
- **Training Dataset Export:** Allow export of low/high-quality outputs and associated feedback for ML retraining.
- **AICT and WPOE Signal Injection:** Provide quality trend data to tuning and performance engines.
- **Quality Failure Root Cause Correlation:** Link quality dips to recent config changes or system events.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **UI Latency:** All dashboard filters and queries return results within 1 second.
- **Scalability:** Support visualization for millions of outputs and thousands of feedback records.
- **Extensibility:** Support for future quality dimensions and feedback types.
- **Privacy:** Anonymize user feedback where needed for privacy compliance.

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** Workflow Output Quality Evaluation Engine (WOQEE), User Feedback APIs, SLA Enforcement Layer (SQL).
- **Output Interfaces:** Admin Dashboard (DVL), Optimization Modules (AICT, WPOE), External Reporting Tools.

## Configuration Options
- **Quality Thresholds:** Per workflow type.
- **SLA Targets:** Configurable compliance goals.
- **Feedback Categories:** Customizable feedback rating dimensions.
- **Export Format Options:** CSV / JSON / Custom formats.

## Example Use Cases
- Reviewing weekly output quality trends for management reporting.
- Identifying workflows that consistently underperform on quality metrics.
- Exporting negative feedback samples for model retraining.
- Monitoring SLA compliance for content quality guarantees.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **Custom Feedback Forms:** Allow organizations to define their own feedback fields.
- **External Feedback Sync:** Ingest feedback from third-party user feedback systems.
- **Anomaly Detection Plugins:** Auto-flag unusual quality score fluctuations.

## Testing and Validation Plan
- Quality metric aggregation accuracy tests.
- Feedback-to-output mapping validation.
- SLA compliance calculation tests.
- Dashboard filter performance benchmarking.

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **Workflow Output Quality Evaluation Engine (WOQEE)**
- **SLA Enforcement Layer (SQL)**
- **Admin Control Panel (ACP)**

## Future Enhancements
- AI-driven quality failure root cause analysis.
- User satisfaction heatmaps.
- Live quality monitoring widgets.
- Predictive quality trend forecasting.
