# Skald Module Specification: Immutable Compliance Archive Manager (ICAM)

## Module Name
**Skald Immutable Compliance Archive Manager (ICAM)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Skald Immutable Compliance Archive Manager (ICAM) governs the secure, write-once, long-term storage of all compliance-critical Skald data, including audit logs, SLA breach records, configuration change histories, and workflow execution summaries. ICAM ensures that all archived data remains tamper-proof, immutable, and accessible for external regulatory audits and internal governance reviews.

## Purpose
To meet internal and external compliance obligations (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, ISO 27001, etc.) by providing cryptographically enforced, auditable, and queryable storage for Skald system compliance data over required retention periods.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Immutable Archive Storage
- **WORM Storage Engine:** Enforce write-once, read-many constraints.
- **Cryptographic Integrity Checks:** Append cryptographic hashes and digital signatures to each archived record.
- **Chain-of-Custody Verification:** Maintain a sequential ledger of archive writes and access logs.

### 2. Archive Ingestion Pipeline
- **Automatic Compliance Data Feed:** Consume data from CALE, SCRD, WPOE, and other compliance-sensitive modules.
- **Retention Policy Enforcement:** Apply module-specific retention durations (e.g., 7 years for audit logs, 2 years for SLA reports).
- **Pre-Archive Data Validation:** Ensure structural and schema correctness before archival.

### 3. Archive Retrieval and Access API
- **Time-Bound Query Support:** Retrieve archive records based on time windows and data type filters.
- **Access Audit Logging:** Record every access attempt, including user, reason, and scope of query.
- **Export for External Review:** Allow generation of packaged compliance datasets for external auditors.
- **Data Redaction API:** Mask sensitive fields during export for privacy compliance.

### 4. Compliance Event Reporting
- **Retention Compliance Reports:** Show active retention policies and dataset coverage.
- **Integrity Verification Reports:** Allow admins and auditors to verify archive chain-of-trust for selected timeframes.
- **Access History Reports:** Generate full logs of archive read and export actions.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Integrity:** All archive writes must be cryptographically verifiable.
- **Durability:** Data must survive node failures, storage outages, and system restarts.
- **Scalability:** Support multi-petabyte archive sizes.
- **Performance:** Sub-2s retrieval latency for standard time-bounded queries.
- **Security:** Enforce strict RBAC and encryption for all archive data.

## Data Flow Diagram (Textual)

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** Central Audit Logging Engine (CALE), SLA Compliance Dashboard (SCRD), Workflow Performance Engine (WPOE), Admin Control Panel (ACP).
- **Output Interfaces:** Audit Report Generator (ARGEM), External Compliance Tools, Admin Dashboards (DVL).

## Configuration Options
- **Retention Periods:** Per data category.
- **Export Redaction Profiles:** Configurable for privacy-sensitive exports.
- **Integrity Check Schedule:** Define periodic self-audit intervals.
- **Access Control Rules:** Per data type and user role.

## Example Use Cases
- Exporting a full 3-year audit log archive for an external GDPR audit.
- Verifying archive integrity after a storage hardware upgrade.
- Reviewing all SLA breach events stored in the compliance archive.
- Responding to a regulatory data retention audit request.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **Blockchain-Backed Archive Option:** For ultra-high integrity requirements.
- **External Compliance System Integrations:** Push archives to external regulatory portals.
- **Dynamic Retention Policy Loader:** Allow runtime updates to retention rules.

## Testing and Validation Plan
- Integrity check validation against tampered data.
- Retention policy compliance audits.
- Archive export format verification.
- Access control and audit trail consistency tests.

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **Central Audit Logging Engine (CALE)**
- **SLA Compliance and Risk Dashboard (SCRD)**
- **Workflow Performance Optimization Engine (WPOE)**
- **Admin Control Panel (ACP)**
- **Audit Report Generation Module (ARGEM)**

## Future Enhancements
- AI-driven compliance risk trend analysis.
- Automated policy-based archive pruning with cryptographic proofs.
- Distributed multi-region archive replication.
- Zero-knowledge proof verification for archive access.
