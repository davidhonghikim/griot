# Skald Module Specification: External Storage Integration Broker (ESIB)

## Module Name
**Skald External Storage Integration Broker (ESIB)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Skald External Storage Integration Broker (ESIB) facilitates bi-directional data exchange between Skald’s internal storage subsystems (WSPE, HEARS, OASDL, LTMS) and external storage services such as cloud object stores, partner-managed archives, distributed file systems, and legacy data warehouses.

## Purpose
To enable flexible, secure, and policy-controlled data movement between Skald and external storage providers for backup, data federation, data sharing, regulatory archiving, or external analytics workflows.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. External Storage Connector Framework
- **Connector Plugins:** Support S3, GCS, Azure Blob, HDFS, NFS, FTP/SFTP, and partner proprietary stores.
- **Credential Management:** Secure storage and retrieval of external storage credentials.
- **Protocol Abstraction:** Allow Skald modules to interact with external storage without needing to handle low-level storage APIs.

### 2. Data Export Services
- **Scheduled Exports:** Support periodic export jobs (e.g., daily backups).
- **On-Demand Exports:** Allow immediate data export via admin-triggered or API-triggered jobs.
- **Data Format Conversion:** Optionally convert data formats (e.g., JSON to CSV, binary serialization to Avro) during export.
- **Export Policy Enforcement:** Apply retention, encryption, and target location rules on exports.

### 3. Data Import Services
- **External Data Ingestion:** Support importing workflow definitions, artifact batches, or historical telemetry from external stores.
- **Data Normalization:** Convert external data into Skald’s internal canonical formats.
- **Integrity Verification:** Validate checksums or digital signatures on imported data.

### 4. Monitoring and Auditability
- **Transfer Logs:** Record all export/import activities, including source, destination, size, and success/failure status.
- **Notification Hooks:** Alert admins on large transfers, failures, or unusual access patterns.
- **Throughput Metrics:** Track transfer rates and durations.

### 5. Performance and Scaling
- **Parallel Transfer Support:** Allow concurrent multi-threaded data transfers.
- **Throttling Controls:** Prevent external storage saturation.
- **Retry Policies:** Automatic retries for transient transfer failures.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Security:** Full encryption (TLS in transit, optional at-rest) for all external storage interactions.
- **Extensibility:** Pluggable connector framework for future storage backends.
- **Reliability:** Resume support for interrupted large transfers.
- **Compliance:** Support for GDPR, CCPA, and other data transfer regulations.

2. **External Storage Source → ESIB Import Handler → Skald Internal Storage Module**

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** Admin Control Panel (ACP), Skald Storage Modules (WSPE, HEARS, OASDL, LTMS).
- **Output Interfaces:** External Storage Services (S3, GCS, etc.), Admin Dashboards (DVL), Audit Logging (ALC).

## Configuration Options
- **Enabled Storage Backends:** Configurable.
- **Transfer Throttling Rate:** Per backend.
- **Retry Limits:** Per job type.
- **Encryption Policies:** On/Off, Algorithm Selection.

## Example Use Cases
- Exporting daily artifact archives to an S3 bucket.
- Importing legacy workflow definitions from an FTP server.
- Federating telemetry data with a partner’s HDFS cluster.
- Backing up SLA compliance reports to long-term cold storage.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **Custom Storage Connector API:** Allow developers to add new storage backends.
- **Dynamic Export Job Scheduler:** For complex export timing needs.
- **External IAM Integration:** Leverage external identity systems for access control.

## Testing and Validation Plan
- Multi-gigabyte transfer performance tests.
- Transfer failure simulation and retry validation.
- Storage backend credential rotation tests.
- Data integrity post-transfer verification.

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **All Skald Storage Modules (WSPE, HEARS, OASDL, LTMS)**
- **Audit Logging and Compliance Engine (ALC)**
- **Admin Control Panel (ACP)**

## Future Enhancements
- AI-driven transfer scheduling based on load forecasts.
- Bandwidth-adaptive transfer throttling.
- Multi-region replication support.
- Storage backend health monitoring.
