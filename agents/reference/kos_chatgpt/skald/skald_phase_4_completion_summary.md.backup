# Skald Phase 4 Completion Summary

## Overview
Phase 4 of the Skald Node Class development is now fully completed. This phase focused on the low-level specification and design documentation of all primary Skald module components, providing a fully detailed, production-ready reference for engineering and deployment teams.

## Phase 4 Deliverables
- ✅ Full low-level functional and non-functional specifications
- ✅ Detailed data flow descriptions
- ✅ Input/Output interface definitions
- ✅ Configuration and extensibility options
- ✅ Testing and validation plans
- ✅ Dependency mappings
- ✅ Future enhancement roadmaps

## Next Steps

- ✅ Archive and distribute Phase 4 document set for internal and external development teams
- ✅ Begin Phase 5 module specifications (focusing on orchestration, scheduling, and runtime pipeline management across Skald and other kOS node classes)

## Download and Access
All Phase 4 specification Markdown files are available for download and archival in the current workspace.
