# Skald Module Specification: Historical Execution Archive and Retrieval System (HEARS)

## Module Name
**Skald Historical Execution Archive and Retrieval System (HEARS)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Skald Historical Execution Archive and Retrieval System (HEARS) provides long-term, queryable storage for completed workflow execution records, system logs, and historical state snapshots. HEARS supports audit, compliance, troubleshooting, and retrospective analytics use cases.

## Purpose
To ensure that all completed workflow execution metadata, state timelines, and runtime logs are durably archived and efficiently retrievable for historical review, SLA verification, and compliance reporting.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Long-Term Workflow Archival
- **Completed Workflow Archiving:** Store full execution metadata for all completed workflows.
- **State Timeline Preservation:** Retain full state transition sequences from WSPE for each archived workflow.
- **Error History Inclusion:** Include error logs and remediation steps taken for each workflow.

### 2. Query and Retrieval API
- **Flexible Query Engine:** Support filtering by date range, user, workflow type, status, or SLA compliance.
- **Searchable Execution Metadata:** Allow text-based and attribute-based search across archived records.
- **Pagination and Result Streaming:** Support large result sets with streaming API support.

### 3. Data Retention and Tiering
- **Configurable Retention Policies:** Support admin-defined retention periods per workflow type.
- **Cold Storage Tiering:** Move older records to lower-cost, slower-access storage backends.
- **Archival Compaction:** Periodically compress and deduplicate historical data.

### 4. Audit and Compliance Features
- **Immutable Archival Mode:** Optionally enable WORM (Write Once, Read Many) for compliance-sensitive workflows.
- **Audit Event Tagging:** Allow tagging workflows for compliance audits.
- **Historical SLA Report Generator:** Generate SLA adherence reports over time windows.

### 5. Performance and Optimization
- **Indexing:** Support time-based, user-based, and status-based indexing.
- **Compression:** Apply space-efficient archival compression algorithms.
- **Background Archival Jobs:** Run non-blocking background archival workers.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Query Latency:** Sub-500ms for standard metadata queries.
- **Scalability:** Support billions of historical workflow records.
- **Extensibility:** Support for additional storage backends (e.g., S3, GCS, HDFS).
- **Reliability:** Guaranteed non-lossy archival of all finalized workflows.

## Data Flow Diagram (Textual)

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** Workflow Orchestrator (SWO), Workflow State Persistence Engine (WSPE), Audit Logging and Compliance Engine (ALC).
- **Output Interfaces:** Admin Dashboards (DVL), External Reporting Tools, API Consumers.

## Configuration Options
- **Retention Period Per Workflow Type:** Configurable.
- **Storage Backend Type:** SQL, NoSQL, Object Storage.
- **Cold Storage Tiering Threshold:** Time-based or volume-based.
- **Immutable Archival Mode:** On/Off.

## Example Use Cases
- Generating quarterly SLA compliance reports for enterprise clients.
- Auditing execution histories for regulatory investigations.
- Retrieving full state histories of specific failed workflows.
- Conducting post-mortem reviews of system outages.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **External Audit System Integrations:** Export archives for third-party audits.
- **Custom Retention Policy Plugins:** For complex data governance rules.
- **Query Plugin Framework:** For organization-specific reporting needs.

## Testing and Validation Plan
- Archival write consistency tests.
- Historical data query performance benchmarking.
- Retention policy enforcement validation.
- SLA report generation accuracy tests.

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **Workflow State Persistence Engine (WSPE)**
- **Audit Logging and Compliance Engine (ALC)**
- **Admin Control Panel (ACP)**
- **Dashboard and Visualization Layer (DVL)**

## Future Enhancements
- AI-driven anomaly detection in historical execution trends.
- Federated multi-node archival queries.
- Blockchain-backed immutability for compliance-sensitive archives.
- Natural language search over historical workflow metadata.
