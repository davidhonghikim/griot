# Skald Phase 14 - Module 5: Ethical Tone and Language Adjustment Engine (ETLAE)

## Node Class: Skald (Communication & Expression)

## Phase 14 Focus:
Real-Time Ethical Tone Shaping and Language Risk Management

---

## 1. Module Overview
The **Ethical Tone and Language Adjustment Engine (ETLAE)** provides Skald agents with dynamic control over the tone, intensity, formality, and emotional language of all generated outputs. This module ensures that agent language remains ethically appropriate, emotionally calibrated, and contextually sensitive at the sentence and paragraph level.

Unlike CASF and RHGL, which handle audience sensitivity and humor-specific risks, ETLAE focuses on the overall tone, vocabulary intensity, and emotional charge of all content streams.

## 2. Primary Functions

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Tone Intent Detection Engine** | Analyzes user input and task metadata to determine desired tone (e.g., formal, empathetic, authoritative, neutral). |
| **Emotional Risk Analyzer** | Detects emotionally charged language that may cause distress, anxiety, anger, or offense. |
| **Ethical Tone Compliance Checker** | Validates content tone against active ethical and organizational communication policies. |
| **Language Softening / Intensification Layer** | Adjusts phrasing to increase or decrease emotional intensity as needed. |
| **Formality and Professionalism Filter** | Ensures outputs meet required professional standards (academic, legal, medical, etc.). |
| **Escalation Trigger System** | Flags outputs with extreme tone shifts or language that may violate ethical guidelines for human or multi-agent review. |
| **Adaptive Tone Modulator** | Learns over time to refine tone adjustments based on audience feedback and prior tone effectiveness data. |
| **Audit Annotation Layer** | Tags output with tone adjustment metadata and decision rationale for transparency. |

## 3. Data Inputs

| Input | Source |
| --- | --- |
| **Draft Content** | From Skald Story Assembly Engine or upstream modules |

## 5. Processing Pipeline

1. Analyze task metadata and user intent for tone goals
2. Scan draft content for emotional risk indicators
3. Evaluate tone against ethical and organizational policies
4. Adjust language, tone, and intensity as required
5. Generate decision rationale and tone adjustment tags
6. Forward tone-adjusted draft to GEPDE for ethics check
