# Skald Module Specification: Inter-Node Routing and Communication Engine (INRCE)

## Module Name
**Skald Inter-Node Routing and Communication Engine (INRCE)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Skald Inter-Node Routing and Communication Engine (INRCE) provides reliable, secure, and policy-compliant message and workflow routing between Skald nodes deployed across distributed environments (local, remote, cloud, hybrid). It enables multi-node Skald deployments to collaborate, distribute workloads, and share data in real time.

## Purpose
To support scalable, resilient, and intelligent inter-node communication across geographically or logically distributed Skald node deployments while enforcing data sovereignty, security, and ethical interoperability policies.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Node Discovery and Directory
- **Node Registry:** Maintain a directory of active Skald nodes with metadata (location, capabilities, trust score).
- **Dynamic Discovery:** Support auto-registration and discovery of new Skald nodes at runtime.
- **Node Health Monitoring:** Track reachability and responsiveness of each node.

### 2. Message and Workflow Routing
- **Intelligent Routing Engine:** Decide optimal target node for each routed message or workflow (based on load, capability, geography, etc.).
- **Multi-Hop Support:** Support indirect routing paths through intermediate nodes.
- **Workflow Handoff:** Enable full workflow migration from one node to another (stateful continuation).
- **Load-Aware Routing:** Factor in node resource usage metrics for routing decisions.

### 3. Security and Trust Enforcement
- **Node Trust Scoring:** Rate and validate node trustworthiness based on historical behavior and external trust registries.
- **Encryption-in-Transit:** Full TLS or equivalent encryption for inter-node messaging.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Mutual authentication between nodes with certificate or key-based verification.

### 4. Protocol Support
- **Multi-Protocol Routing:** Support gRPC, WebSocket, HTTP, AMQP, or custom protocols for inter-node traffic.
- **Protocol Negotiation:** Allow source and destination nodes to negotiate transport protocol at runtime.

### 5. Reliability and Resilience
- **Message Queuing and Retries:** Buffer and retry undeliverable messages.
- **Dead Letter Queues:** Capture permanently failed routing attempts for manual inspection.
- **Timeout Handling:** Prevent infinite waiting on unreachable nodes.

### 6. Observability and Monitoring
- **Routing Logs:** Maintain detailed records of all inter-node traffic.
- **Metrics Dashboard Integration:** Expose routing stats (latency, throughput, failures) for real-time monitoring.
- **Anomaly Detection Hooks:** Support future AI-based detection of unusual inter-node communication patterns.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Latency:** Sub-100ms routing decision time for most messages.
- **Scalability:** Support hundreds to thousands of nodes in a deployment.
- **Availability:** 99.999% uptime target for routing services.
- **Extensibility:** Allow developers to add new routing algorithms and policies.

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** Skald Internal Modules (SWO, Runtime Scheduler), GEIG, PAL.
- **Output Interfaces:** External Node Communication Channels (via PAL), Logging Systems, Trust Scoring Engine.

## Configuration Options
- **Routing Policies:** Load-based / Geo-based / Trust-based / Round-robin / Custom.
- **Node Trust Levels:** Configurable per node.
- **Retry Limits:** Configurable per message type.
- **Encryption Settings:** TLS config per inter-node link.

## Example Use Cases
- Distributing a bulk NLP workload across multiple Skald nodes in different data centers.
- Migrating an in-progress workflow from an overloaded node to a healthier one.
- Sending status updates between geographically distributed Skald clusters.
- Routing low-trust traffic through hardened relay nodes.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **Custom Routing Algorithms:** Plug in new routing decision engines.
- **Protocol Plugin Support:** For emerging communication protocols.
- **Federated Node Governance Plugins:** For cross-org multi-node collaboration policies.

## Testing and Validation Plan
- Multi-node message delivery tests.
- Network partition and recovery simulations.
- Routing performance benchmarking.
- Security validation for trust and encryption enforcement.

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **Skald Global Ethical Interoperability Gateway (GEIG)**
- **Protocol Adapter Layer (PAL)**
- **Audit Logging and Compliance Engine (ALC)**
- **Resource Utilization Monitor (RUM)**

## Future Enhancements
- AI-based adaptive routing.
- Global node federation registries.
- Multi-cloud routing optimization.
- SLA-aware routing decisions.
