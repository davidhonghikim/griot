# Skald Module Specification: Load Balancer and Node Dispatcher (LND)

## Module Name
**Skald Load Balancer and Node Dispatcher (LND)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Skald Load Balancer and Node Dispatcher (LND) is responsible for distributing incoming workflow execution tasks and Skald module operations across available computational nodes or worker instances. It ensures even load distribution, prevents resource bottlenecks, and dynamically scales Skald execution capacity across the kOS network.

## Purpose
To provide intelligent, real-time load balancing and task dispatching for all Skald runtime operations, improving system performance, reliability, and scalability.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Load Balancing Strategies
- **Round-Robin:** Distribute jobs sequentially across nodes.
- **Least-Loaded Node:** Dispatch to nodes with the lowest current CPU/memory load.
- **Weighted Distribution:** Support nodes with different resource profiles.
- **Geographic Awareness:** Prefer local nodes for latency-sensitive workflows.

### 2. Node Health Monitoring
- **Heartbeat Checks:** Periodic ping to each node for health status.
- **Resource Metrics Collection:** CPU, RAM, disk I/O, and network utilization per node.
- **Failure Detection:** Mark unresponsive nodes as offline and reroute jobs.
- **Auto-Recovery:** Automatically reintroduce recovered nodes into the pool.

### 3. Dispatching Logic
- **Task Type Affinity:** Certain tasks can prefer or require specific node types (e.g., GPU nodes for ML tasks).
- **Queue Overflow Management:** Spillover routing to secondary nodes when primary nodes are saturated.
- **Node Reservation Support:** Reserve nodes for specific workflows or high-priority tasks.

### 4. Dynamic Scaling (Optional)
- **Elastic Node Pool:** Scale out (add nodes) or scale in (reduce nodes) based on load thresholds.
- **Auto-Discovery:** Automatically recognize and integrate new nodes.
- **Cloud/On-Prem Hybrid Support:** Dispatch across mixed deployment environments.

### 5. Security and Access Control
- **Node Authentication:** Only trusted nodes can join the dispatcher pool.
- **Encrypted Job Dispatch:** Secure transmission of job payloads.
- **Role-Based Task Allocation:** Restrict sensitive workloads to certified nodes.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Latency:** Sub-50ms dispatch decision time.
- **Scalability:** Support hundreds to thousands of nodes.
- **Reliability:** Graceful failover to backup nodes.
- **Extensibility:** Plug-in framework for custom load balancing policies.

## Data Flow Diagram (Textual)
1. **Workflow Job Submission (from SRS)** → 2. **Load Evaluation Engine** → 3. **Node Selector** → 4. **Task Dispatcher** → 5. **Execution Node** → 6. **Node Status Updater**

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** Skald Runtime Scheduler (SRS), Skald Workflow Orchestrator (SWO).
- **Output Interfaces:** Execution Nodes, Error Handling Engine (EHR), Resource Utilization Monitor (RUM).

## Configuration Options
- **Load Balancing Policy:** (Round-Robin / Least-Loaded / Weighted / Custom)
- **Node Health Check Interval:** (Default: 10 seconds)
- **Max Jobs Per Node:** (Default: 100 concurrent tasks)
- **Auto-Scaling Thresholds:** CPU/RAM usage %

## Example Use Cases
- Spreading translation jobs evenly across multiple Skald nodes.
- Redirecting failed tasks away from overloaded or failing nodes.
- Scaling up narrative generation capacity during peak traffic.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **Custom Node Selection Plugins:** For domain-specific dispatch logic.
- **External Node Status Feed Integration:** Allow third-party monitoring tools to feed node metrics.
- **Cloud Provider API Hooks:** For elastic node management.

## Testing and Validation Plan
- Load balancing fairness tests.
- Node failure simulation and recovery validation.
- High-concurrency dispatch stress testing.
- Latency benchmarking under load.

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **Skald Runtime Scheduler (SRS)**
- **Execution Nodes (worker nodes running Skald modules)**
- **Resource Utilization Monitor (RUM)**

## Future Enhancements
- AI-driven predictive load balancing.
- Global node federation across geographic regions.
- SLA-aware scheduling (Service Level Agreements).
- Self-healing node orchestration with auto-migration.
