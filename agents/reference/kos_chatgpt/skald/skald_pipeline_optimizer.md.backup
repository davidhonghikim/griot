# Skald Module Specification: Pipeline Optimizer (SPO)

## Module Name
**Skald Pipeline Optimizer (SPO)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Skald Pipeline Optimizer (SPO) is responsible for analyzing, reconfiguring, and dynamically optimizing Skald execution pipelines at runtime. It focuses on improving workflow efficiency, reducing latency, minimizing resource consumption, and adapting Skald module sequences based on real-time system conditions and historical performance metrics.

## Purpose
To ensure that Skald workflows run as efficiently and effectively as possible by applying real-time and historical optimization strategies to pipeline execution, module ordering, concurrency, and resource allocation.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Workflow Pipeline Analysis
- **Dependency Graph Construction:** Map module dependencies and execution order per workflow.
- **Bottleneck Detection:** Identify modules causing latency spikes or execution slowdowns.
- **Resource Impact Scoring:** Calculate resource cost estimates per module sequence.

### 2. Dynamic Pipeline Optimization
- **Execution Reordering:** Rearrange non-dependent modules for parallel or more efficient execution.
- **Module Skipping:** Bypass unnecessary steps based on workflow inputs and goals.
- **Dynamic Resource Allocation:** Adjust concurrency levels or resource assignments per workflow.
- **Runtime Policy Injection:** Apply optimization policies (e.g., speed-first, resource-conservation, accuracy-priority).

### 3. Feedback Loop with Runtime Components
- **Scheduler Feedback:** Inform SRS for re-prioritization and rescheduling.
- **Load Balancer Tuning:** Adjust node selection bias in LND based on optimization goals.
- **Workflow Orchestrator Guidance:** Provide orchestration hints for better step grouping.

### 4. AI/ML-Assisted Optimization (Optional)
- **Historical Performance Learning:** Analyze execution history to suggest optimizations.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Anticipate workflow performance impacts based on real-time metrics.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Flag workflows that are behaving abnormally compared to past runs.

### 5. Monitoring and Metrics
- **Pipeline Efficiency Scores:** Generate metrics for each workflow execution.
- **Optimization Impact Reporting:** Measure before/after impact of each optimization decision.
- **Dashboard Feed:** Export optimization stats to monitoring UIs.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Latency:** Optimization decision overhead under 100ms.
- **Scalability:** Handle optimization for thousands of concurrent workflows.
- **Reliability:** Fall back to default pipeline if optimizer fails.
- **Extensibility:** Allow injection of new optimization strategies or AI models.

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** Skald Workflow Orchestrator (SWO), Scheduler (SRS), Resource Monitor (RUM).
- **Output Interfaces:** Skald Scheduler (SRS), Load Balancer (LND), Monitoring Dashboards.

## Configuration Options
- **Optimization Mode:** (Latency / Resource / Balanced / Custom)
- **Module Reordering Permissions:** (Strict / Flexible)
- **AI Assistance Level:** (Off / Suggestive / Autonomous)
- **Thresholds for Reoptimization:** (e.g., workflow running longer than X seconds)

## Example Use Cases
- Reordering translation and summarization steps to run in parallel.
- Skipping sentiment analysis for low-priority workflows.
- Dynamically adjusting concurrency levels for batch jobs during peak load.
- Reallocating workflows away from resource-constrained nodes.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **Custom Optimization Policies:** Allow developers to define custom pipeline scoring logic.
- **External Optimization Model Integration:** Support for ML models deployed in external services.
- **Workflow Template Auto-Rewriting:** Future ability to rewrite workflow definitions pre-execution.

## Testing and Validation Plan
- Controlled workflow execution benchmarks.
- Latency impact tests.
- Resource savings validation.
- Failure mode tests with optimizer disabled.

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **Skald Workflow Orchestrator (SWO)**
- **Skald Runtime Scheduler (SRS)**
- **Skald Load Balancer (LND)**
- **Skald Resource Utilization Monitor (RUM)**

## Future Enhancements
- Real-time reinforcement learning-based optimization.
- User-tunable optimization profiles via API or UI.
- Support for self-healing and auto-correcting pipeline errors.
- Optimization visualization dashboard.
