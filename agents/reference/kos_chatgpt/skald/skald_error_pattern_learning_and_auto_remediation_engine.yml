# Skald Module Specification: Error Pattern Learning and Auto-Remediation Engine (EPLARE)

## Module Name
**Skald Error Pattern Learning and Auto-Remediation Engine (EPLARE)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Skald Error Pattern Learning and Auto-Remediation Engine (EPLARE) uses AI and statistical analysis to identify recurring error patterns, predict likely failure conditions, and implement automated remediation steps before or immediately after failures occur. EPLARE helps minimize downtime, improve system resilience, and reduce manual intervention.

## Purpose
To learn from Skald runtime error history, analyze system health signals, and proactively prevent, mitigate, or automatically resolve common failure scenarios with minimal human involvement.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Error Pattern Analysis
- **Error Log Aggregation:** Collect error logs from all Skald modules (via ALC).
- **Pattern Detection:** Use clustering and anomaly detection models to identify repeating error types and triggers.
- **Failure Prediction Models:** Predict imminent module or workflow failures based on leading error indicators.

### 2. Automated Remediation Actions
- **Predefined Fix Actions:** Restart module, clear queues, flush caches, reroute workflows, etc.
- **AI-Recommended Fixes:** Suggest remediation steps based on historical success rates.
- **Self-Healing Triggers:** Allow auto-execution of fixes for high-confidence scenarios.
- **Rollback and Retry Logic:** Provide safe fallback in case remediation worsens the issue.

### 3. Learning and Feedback Loop
- **Success Tracking:** Monitor post-remediation system state to evaluate remediation effectiveness.
- **Continuous Model Updating:** Retrain error prediction and remediation models with new incidents.
- **Admin Feedback Capture:** Allow manual validation/correction of AI-recommended actions.

### 4. Monitoring and Reporting
- **Error Resolution Dashboard:** Show error frequency trends and remediation outcomes.
- **Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Reports:** Generate automated RCA reports for recurring issues.
- **Alerting:** Notify admins for manual intervention when AI confidence is low.

### 5. Safety and Governance
- **Remediation Risk Scoring:** Rate potential remediation actions by risk level.
- **Approval Gates:** Allow admins to require manual approval for high-risk auto-remediations.
- **Audit Logging:** Log every remediation action, trigger condition, and outcome.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Latency:** Sub-100ms detection-to-action cycle time for fast failure modes.
- **Scalability:** Support error monitoring across thousands of modules.
- **Resilience:** Fail-safe behavior if remediation modules crash.
- **Extensibility:** Support for custom remediation playbooks.

## Data Flow Diagram (Textual)
1. **Error Events from ALC → EPLARE Error Analyzer → Failure Predictor → Remediation Decision Engine → Auto-Remediation Executor / Admin Alert → Monitoring Dashboards / Audit Logs**

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** Audit Logging and Compliance Engine (ALC), Resource Utilization Monitor (RUM), Runtime Scheduler (SRS).
- **Output Interfaces:** Admin Control Panel (ACP), Dashboard and Visualization Layer (DVL), Workflow Orchestrator (SWO).

## Configuration Options
- **Auto-Remediation Mode:** Off / Recommend Only / Full Auto-Heal.
- **Risk Thresholds:** Configurable risk tolerance per module.
- **Error Pattern Sensitivity:** High / Medium / Low.
- **Notification Preferences:** Immediate / Batched / Silent.

## Example Use Cases
- Auto-restarting a Skald module stuck in a crash loop.
- Preemptively rerouting workflows away from a node showing early failure signs.
- Notifying admins of emerging error patterns before escalation.
- Generating RCA reports for SLA breach investigations.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **Custom Error Classifiers:** Allow integration of domain-specific error classification models.
- **External Incident Management Integration:** Push incidents to external systems like PagerDuty or ServiceNow.
- **Dynamic Remediation Playbook Loader:** Update remediation actions at runtime.

## Testing and Validation Plan
- Error pattern detection accuracy tests.
- Remediation success rate benchmarking.
- Failure mode simulation testing.
- Safety rollback scenario validation.

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **Audit Logging and Compliance Engine (ALC)**
- **Resource Utilization Monitor (RUM)**
- **Workflow Orchestrator (SWO)**
- **Admin Control Panel (ACP)**

## Future Enhancements
- Reinforcement learning for remediation strategy selection.
- Self-evolving remediation playbooks.
- AI-based root cause inference.
- External knowledge base integration for remediation suggestions.
