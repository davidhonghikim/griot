# Skald Module Specification: Workflow State Tracker (WST)

## Module Name
**Skald Workflow State Tracker (WST)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Skald Workflow State Tracker (WST) is the internal tracking and state management system that records, monitors, and updates the execution state of every active and historical Skald workflow. It enables real-time visibility into workflow progress, step-by-step status, and lifecycle transitions.

## Purpose
To provide a single source of truth for the state of all Skald workflows across their entire execution lifecycle, supporting monitoring, debugging, auditing, and orchestration functions.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. State Definition and Lifecycle Management
- **State Model:** Support for states like: Queued → Running → Completed → Failed → Canceled → Retried → Archived.
- **Custom State Extension:** Allow developers to define additional workflow states if needed.
- **State Transition Rules:** Enforce allowed transitions to prevent illegal state jumps.

### 2. State Recording and Persistence
- **Real-Time State Updates:** Immediate state change recording from runtime modules.
- **Persistent Storage:** Long-term storage of workflow state histories for auditing and recovery.
- **Transactional Consistency:** Ensure atomicity of state updates.

### 3. State Query and Retrieval
- **Workflow ID Lookup:** Retrieve state history by unique workflow ID.
- **Multi-Criteria Search:** Search workflows by state, timestamp, node, module, or error condition.
- **Timeline View Support:** Provide timestamped stepwise state progression for UI renderers.

### 4. Event Emission and Notification
- **State Change Events:** Emit events on the kOS Event Bus for each state transition.
- **Webhook Triggers:** Allow external systems to subscribe to state change notifications.
- **Failure and Timeout Alerts:** Notify EHR or monitoring dashboards on critical state transitions.

### 5. Analytics and Metrics
- **Workflow Success Rate Statistics:** Calculate percentage success/failure rates.
- **Average Execution Time Tracking:** Monitor performance trends.
- **Stuck Workflow Detection:** Identify workflows stuck in undefined or long-running states.

### 6. Security and Access Control
- **Read/Write Role Segmentation:** Only authorized modules and users can write state changes.
- **Immutable Audit Trail:** Non-editable state history for compliance.
- **Encrypted State Storage:** Protect sensitive workflow metadata.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Latency:** State updates recorded within 50ms of event occurrence.
- **Scalability:** Support millions of workflow state records.
- **Reliability:** Zero data loss guarantee for state changes.
- **Extensibility:** Allow plug-in modules for custom state management logic.

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** Skald Runtime Scheduler (SRS), Load Balancer (LND), Workflow Orchestrator (SWO), Error Handler (EHR).
- **Output Interfaces:** kOS Event Bus, Monitoring Dashboards, External Webhooks.

## Configuration Options
- **State Retention Period:** (Default: 30 days)
- **Alert Thresholds:** (Max execution time per state, failure rate limits)
- **Custom State Definitions:** Configurable per deployment.

## Example Use Cases
- Real-time monitoring of workflow progress in a dashboard.
- Historical audit of all translation workflows from past 7 days.
- Identifying and auto-restarting stuck narrative generation jobs.
- Tracking average execution time of sentiment analysis workflows.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **Custom State Processors:** For domain-specific state transitions.
- **External Notification Plugins:** Integrate with third-party monitoring tools.
- **State Archival Connectors:** For long-term cold storage solutions.

## Testing and Validation Plan
- State transition unit tests.
- High-volume write throughput tests.
- Failure recovery tests.
- Latency benchmarking for state writes and reads.

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **Skald Runtime Components (SWO, SRS, LND, etc.)**
- **Persistent Storage Backend**
- **Monitoring and Notification Layers**

## Future Enhancements
- Graph-based workflow state visualizations.
- Predictive state modeling using ML.
- Automatic stuck workflow remediation.
- API-driven state manipulation for advanced operators.
