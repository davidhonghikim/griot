# Skald Module Specification: Configuration and Version Snapshot Manager (CVSM)

## Module Name
**Skald Configuration and Version Snapshot Manager (CVSM)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Skald Configuration and Version Snapshot Manager (CVSM) provides version-controlled storage, retrieval, and rollback capabilities for all system configurations, policy definitions, module parameter sets, and workflow templates. CVSM ensures system state traceability, auditability, and reproducibility across configuration changes.

## Purpose
To allow Skald administrators and automated systems to track, version, and restore any configuration state or system policy, supporting auditing, rollback after misconfigurations, deployment automation, and historical configuration analysis.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Configuration Versioning
- **Snapshot Storage:** Persist full snapshots of all Skald configurations, policies, and templates.
- **Version Metadata:** Track change author, timestamp, description, and change diffs.
- **Change Detection:** Automatically detect config changes and trigger version capture.

### 2. Rollback and Restore
- **Version History Navigation:** Allow users to browse and query historical configuration versions.
- **Rollback Execution:** Enable full or partial rollback to a selected previous configuration state.
- **Rollback Safety Checks:** Validate rollback compatibility and detect dependency issues before applying.

### 3. Diff and Audit Tools
- **Config Diff Viewer:** Compare any two configuration versions with field-level diffs.
- **Audit Trail Generator:** Export full config change history for compliance purposes.
- **Notification Hooks:** Notify stakeholders when sensitive configuration changes occur.

### 4. Deployment Support
- **Staged Deployment Mode:** Allow testing config changes in sandbox before production rollout.
- **Multi-Node Sync:** Push configuration snapshots across distributed Skald nodes.
- **Automated Config Promotion:** Support CI/CD pipeline integration for configuration updates.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Latency:** Snapshot capture and retrieval in under 500ms.
- **Scalability:** Support thousands of config versions.
- **Reliability:** Zero config loss during storage or rollback.
- **Extensibility:** Support new config object types over time.

## Data Flow Diagram (Textual)
1. **Configuration Change Trigger → CVSM Snapshot Creator → Versioned Storage → Diff Engine / Rollback Executor / Audit Log Exporter / Admin Dashboard**

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** Admin Control Panel (ACP), CLI Tools, External CI/CD Pipelines.
- **Output Interfaces:** Admin Dashboards (DVL), Audit Logging and Compliance Engine (ALC), Runtime Configuration Distribution Systems.

## Configuration Options
- **Snapshot Frequency:** Manual / On Change / Scheduled.
- **Retention Policy:** Keep all / Retain last N versions / Time-based purging.
- **Notification Recipients:** Per config type or project.
- **Diff Sensitivity Settings:** Shallow / Deep / Custom.

## Example Use Cases
- Rolling back to a last-known-good configuration after a failed deployment.
- Auditing all config changes made in the last 30 days.
- Previewing differences between test and production configuration states.
- Automating config rollouts via CI/CD pipelines.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **Custom Snapshot Plugins:** For external config stores.
- **External Diff Engines:** Allow pluggable diff analyzers.
- **Notification System Integrations:** Slack, Email, Incident Management.

## Testing and Validation Plan
- Snapshot save/load consistency tests.
- Rollback correctness tests.
- Change detection and diff accuracy tests.
- Multi-node config sync validation.

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **Admin Control Panel (ACP)**
- **Audit Logging and Compliance Engine (ALC)**
- **Dashboard and Visualization Layer (DVL)**

## Future Enhancements
- AI-driven config optimization suggestion engine.
- Multi-environment config diff analysis (Dev/QA/Prod).
- Policy-based auto-revert for high-risk config changes.
- Visual config history timelines.
