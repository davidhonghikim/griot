# Skald Module Specification: Central Audit Logging Engine (CALE)

## Module Name
**Skald Central Audit Logging Engine (CALE)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Skald Central Audit Logging Engine (CALE) serves as the system-wide, immutable logging backbone for all operational, administrative, user, workflow, security, and configuration events across Skald nodes and modules. CALE ensures that every significant system action, decision, change, and event is securely recorded, time-stamped, and queryable for audits, forensic investigations, and compliance validation.

## Purpose
To provide a reliable, tamper-resistant, and high-performance audit trail for all Skald activities, satisfying regulatory requirements, internal governance policies, and security best practices.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Event Capture and Ingestion
- **Universal Event Bus Listener:** Subscribe to all event streams across Skald modules.
- **Structured Log Entry Format:** Enforce standardized JSON-based log schema with timestamp, module, actor, event type, and payload fields.
- **Multi-Level Logging:** Support INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL, and DEBUG levels for each event.

### 2. Immutable Storage and Write Path
- **Append-Only Log Store:** Guarantee write-once, append-only storage for audit logs.
- **WORM Mode (Write Once, Read Many):** Optional for compliance-sensitive environments.
- **Timestamp and Source Verification:** Include cryptographic timestamping and source module signatures for integrity.

### 3. Query and Retrieval API
- **Time-Based Queries:** Fetch logs within specific time windows.
- **Attribute-Based Filtering:** Filter by module, event type, actor, severity, or workflow ID.
- **Streaming Query Mode:** Support live log tailing for security and ops teams.
- **Pagination and Export:** Return large query results in paginated chunks; support CSV and JSON export.

### 4. Retention and Archival Policy Management
- **Configurable Retention Windows:** Per log category or module.
- **Archival Tiering:** Move older logs to cold storage or external systems via ESIB.
- **Purge Policy Enforcement:** Controlled deletion where allowed (only for non-compliance logs).

### 5. Performance and Scalability
- **High Write Throughput:** Support tens of thousands of log writes per second.
- **Low Query Latency:** Return filtered log queries under 500ms for recent logs.
- **Multi-Tenant Partitioning:** Support log separation per tenant where required.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Integrity:** All log entries must be tamper-evident and cryptographically verifiable.
- **Availability:** Zero data loss during node failures or restarts.
- **Extensibility:** Support new event types and modules with minimal config changes.
- **Security:** Enforce strong access controls and encryption for all log storage and retrieval operations.

## Data Flow Diagram (Textual)
1. **Module Event Generation → kOS Event Bus → CALE Event Listener → Log Formatter → Immutable Log Store → Query API / Exporter / External Compliance Systems**

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** All Skald Module Event Streams, kOS Event Bus.
- **Output Interfaces:** Admin Dashboard (DVL), Audit Report Generator (ARGEM), External Storage Integration Broker (ESIB), External Compliance Tools.

## Configuration Options
- **Retention Period:** Per module or log type.
- **Log Storage Backend:** Local disk, distributed log store, external object storage.
- **WORM Mode Activation:** On/Off per tenant or deployment.
- **Log Level Filters:** Allow runtime adjustment of logging verbosity.

## Example Use Cases
- Generating a forensic report of all configuration changes during a specific incident.
- Auditing user login activity across all nodes for the past month.
- Streaming real-time error logs for DevOps monitoring.
- Exporting full audit trails for regulatory compliance submission.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **Custom Event Type Registration:** Allow new event classes without full system restart.
- **External SIEM Connector API:** Stream logs to external SIEM platforms.
- **Anomaly Detection Hooks:** Feed logs into AI-based anomaly detectors.

## Testing and Validation Plan
- Write performance benchmarking.
- Query accuracy and speed tests.
- Tamper-evidence and cryptographic integrity validation.
- WORM mode compliance validation.

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **All Skald Operational Modules**
- **External Storage Integration Broker (ESIB)**
- **Audit Report Generation Module (ARGEM)**

## Future Enhancements
- Blockchain-backed distributed audit log storage.
- AI-driven anomaly scoring on incoming logs.
- Real-time streaming analytics pipeline integration.
- Data retention law (GDPR/CCPA) compliance automation.
