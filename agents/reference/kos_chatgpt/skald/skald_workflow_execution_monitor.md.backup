# Skald Module Specification: Workflow Execution Monitor (WEM)

## Module Name
**Skald Workflow Execution Monitor (WEM)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Skald Workflow Execution Monitor (WEM) provides real-time tracking, monitoring, and lifecycle visualization of all active, queued, failed, and completed workflows across the Skald environment. It offers detailed execution timelines, step-level status visibility, and failure diagnostics for all workflow instances.

## Purpose
To give administrators and operators full visibility into ongoing and historical workflow executions, including their current status, progress through stages, error conditions, and performance metrics.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Real-Time Workflow Status Tracking
- **Execution State Dashboard:** List all workflows by status (Active, Queued, Completed, Failed).
- **Step-Level Progress Monitoring:** Display current execution step, duration per step, and remaining estimated time.
- **Workflow Health Indicators:** Color-coded status icons showing execution health.

### 2. Execution Timeline Visualization
- **Graphical Timeline Views:** Visualize workflow step transitions over time.
- **Historical State Replays:** Allow playback of step-by-step workflow progress for any completed workflow.
- **Time-to-Completion Estimates:** Use historical data to project estimated completion times for in-progress workflows.

### 3. Failure and Error Diagnostics
- **Failure Reason Display:** Show error codes, stack traces, and remediation steps for failed workflows.
- **Alert Integration:** Generate alerts for failed or stalled workflows.
- **Auto-Remediation Status:** Display whether auto-remediation was attempted (EPLARE integration).

### 4. Workflow Control Actions
- **Manual Intervention Tools:** Allow admins to pause, resume, retry, or terminate workflows.
- **Workflow Cloning:** Enable rerunning a workflow with identical parameters.
- **Batch Workflow Controls:** Provide bulk actions for groups of workflows.

### 5. Reporting and Export
- **Execution Summary Export:** Export workflow execution histories as CSV or JSON.
- **Custom Query Builder:** Allow filtered searches (by user, workflow type, status, date range).
- **SLA Violation Flags:** Mark workflows that exceeded SLA thresholds.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **UI Latency:** Workflow status updates should reflect in under 1 second.
- **Scalability:** Monitor and display thousands of concurrent workflows.
- **Extensibility:** Support future workflow types and execution engines.
- **Resilience:** Ensure data consistency even during monitoring service restarts.

## Data Flow Diagram (Textual)
1. **Workflow Runtime Events → WEM State Aggregator → Metrics Store / Execution Timeline Store → Admin Dashboard → User Queries / Alerts / Exports**

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** Workflow Orchestrator (SWO), Workflow State Persistence Engine (WSPE), SLA Enforcement Layer (SQL), Audit Logging (ALC).
- **Output Interfaces:** Admin Dashboard (DVL), Notification Systems, External Reporting Tools.

## Configuration Options
- **Auto-Refresh Interval:** Configurable per user.
- **Failure Alert Thresholds:** Define custom failure alerting rules.
- **History Retention Window:** For historical execution visualizations.
- **UI Display Preferences:** Compact / Expanded / Custom View Modes.

## Example Use Cases
- Monitoring real-time progress of a large content generation batch job.
- Investigating why a high-priority workflow failed.
- Exporting daily workflow execution statistics for external analysis.
- Replaying the execution flow of a previous workflow for debugging.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **Custom Execution View Plugins:** For specialized workflow types.
- **External SLA System Integration:** To flag SLA-violating workflows.
- **AI Anomaly Overlay:** Visual highlight of workflows behaving abnormally.

## Testing and Validation Plan
- Workflow state transition accuracy tests.
- UI update speed benchmarking under load.
- Failure detection and alert generation validation.
- Timeline visualization correctness tests.

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **Workflow Orchestrator (SWO)**
- **Workflow State Persistence Engine (WSPE)**
- **SLA Enforcement Layer (SQL)**
- **Audit Logging and Compliance Engine (ALC)**

## Future Enhancements
- AI-driven workflow health scoring.
- Real-time root cause diagnostics.
- Mobile-optimized workflow monitoring UI.
- Voice or chatbot-driven workflow control commands.
