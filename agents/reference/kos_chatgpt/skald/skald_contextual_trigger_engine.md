# Skald Module Specification: Contextual Trigger Engine (CTE)

## Module Name
**Contextual Trigger Engine (CTE)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Contextual Trigger Engine (CTE) is the submodule within the Skald class responsible for detecting, interpreting, and executing contextually-relevant triggers that activate specific Skald workflows or narrative processes. These triggers may arise from user input, system state changes, external API events, time-based schedules, or environmental sensors.

## Purpose
To provide a low-latency, scalable, and flexible trigger system that allows Skald agents to respond dynamically and intelligently to contextual events, enabling them to initiate the appropriate storytelling, translation, notification, or interaction process.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Trigger Detection
- **Event Listeners:** Listen for incoming trigger events across all registered channels (text, voice, API, sensors, etc.).
- **Multi-Modal Input Support:** Handle triggers from diverse input forms (text strings, sensor readings, API webhooks, system state changes).
- **Event Bus Integration:** Subscribe to internal kOS Event Bus for distributed system-wide triggers.

### 2. Contextual Matching
- **Trigger Pattern Matching:** Use rule-based, ML-based, or hybrid models to match incoming triggers to defined Skald contexts.
- **Natural Language Trigger Parsing:** Parse human language inputs for intent and key contextual cues.
- **Threshold-Based Confidence Scoring:** Only activate workflows if trigger confidence exceeds a pre-defined threshold.

### 3. Trigger Routing
- **Workflow Dispatcher:** Route validated triggers to the appropriate Skald workflow engine (e.g., Narrative Generator, Translator, Summary Engine, etc.).
- **Priority Management:** Queue and prioritize triggers when multiple triggers compete for processing.
- **Load Balancer Integration:** Support horizontal scaling by balancing trigger routing across available Skald nodes.

### 4. Trigger Persistence and Replay
- **Event Logging:** Log all incoming triggers for audit and debugging.
- **Replay Mechanism:** Enable replay of past triggers for testing or simulation.
- **Dead Letter Queue:** Store failed or unprocessed triggers for later manual or automated review.

### 5. Security and Validation
- **Source Authentication:** Validate the source of external triggers.
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevent Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks from rogue trigger floods.
- **Tamper Detection:** Detect and block malformed or spoofed triggers.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **High Throughput:** Able to handle hundreds to thousands of triggers per second in large-scale deployments.
- **Low Latency:** Sub-100ms response time for trigger recognition and routing in standard configurations.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Built-in retry and failover mechanisms.
- **Extensibility:** Modular plugin interface for defining new trigger types and input channels.

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** Webhooks, NLP parsers, system event listeners, external APIs, hardware sensors.
- **Output Interfaces:** Workflow dispatcher queue, Event Bus, Skald submodule endpoints.

## Configuration Options
- **Trigger Confidence Threshold:** (Default: 0.8)
- **Replay Window Duration:** (Default: 30 days)
- **Rate Limit Settings:** (Default: 100 triggers/second per source)
- **Input Channel Enable/Disable:** Configurable per deployment.

## Example Use Cases
- Triggering an urgent translation workflow when foreign language text is detected.
- Initiating a narrative response when a user types specific keywords.
- Launching a summary module when large data logs are ingested.
- Triggering a humor engine when a conversation becomes too tense.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **Custom Trigger Type Plugins:** Developers can write plugins for new input types.
- **Custom Matching Models:** Allow injection of new ML models for trigger classification.
- **Custom Output Routing:** Support for external systems to receive processed triggers.

## Testing and Validation Plan
- Unit tests for each input channel.
- Load tests for high-volume trigger bursts.
- End-to-end tests with simulated contextual workflows.
- Security tests for spoofed and malformed triggers.

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **NLP Engine (Skald NLP Core or external)**
- **Skald Workflow Dispatcher**
- **Skald Trigger Definition Store**

## Future Enhancements
- Real-time trigger visualization dashboard.
- AI-based adaptive trigger tuning (auto-adjust confidence thresholds).
- Integration with third-party IoT event streams.
