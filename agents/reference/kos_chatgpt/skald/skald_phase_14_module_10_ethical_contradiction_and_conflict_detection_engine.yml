# Skald Phase 14 - Module 10: Ethical Contradiction and Conflict Detection Engine (ECCDE)

## Node Class: Skald (Communication & Expression)

## Phase 14 Focus:
Automated Detection of Ethical Contradictions, Logical Inconsistencies, and Policy Conflicts Across Content Generation

---

## 1. Module Overview
The **Ethical Contradiction and Conflict Detection Engine (ECCDE)** provides real-time detection of logical inconsistencies, ethical contradictions, and policy conflicts across all stages of Skald content generation.

ECCDE ensures that outputs remain ethically coherent, logically consistent, and free from self-contradictory reasoning or conflicting policy applications, especially during multi-module content assembly processes.

---

## 2. Primary Functions

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Logical Consistency Validator** | Scans narrative and factual elements for logical contradictions within the content. |
| **Ethical Conflict Detector** | Identifies when multiple ethical rules, audience sensitivities, or jurisdictional requirements conflict during content generation. |
| **Cross-Module Policy Reconciliation Engine** | Resolves inconsistencies caused by upstream modules (e.g., CASF, RHGL, ETLAE) applying overlapping or contradictory filters. |
| **Dynamic Risk Scorer** | Assigns severity levels to detected contradictions and conflicts for prioritization. |
| **Multi-Agent Consensus Trigger** | Escalates high-severity conflicts for multi-agent review or human oversight. |
| **Ethical Contradiction Logging Layer** | Annotates outputs with contradiction detection metadata for downstream analysis. |
| **Suggestive Resolution Engine** | Provides recommended resolution paths (e.g., prioritize jurisdictional policy, favor user preferences, etc.). |
| **Real-Time Block/Pass Decision Handler** | Determines if output should be blocked, flagged, auto-corrected, or passed with disclaimer based on risk threshold. |

---

## 3. Data Inputs

| Input | Source |
| --- | --- |
| **Assembled Content Draft** | From Skald Story Assembly Engine |
| **Ethical Decision Logs** | From GEPDE |
| **Tone and Audience Adjustments** | From CASF, ETLAE, RHGL, CCE |
| **Jurisdictional and Organizational Policy Sets** | From GEPDE and CCETL |

---

## 4. Data Outputs

| Output | Destination |
| --- | --- |
| **Conflict-Annotated Content Draft** | Sent downstream for final GEPDE pass or manual review |
| **Contradiction Risk Score** | Included in audit metadata and system risk dashboards |
| **Escalation Alerts (If Applicable)** | Sent to Human Review Layer or multi-agent quorum |
| **Conflict Resolution Suggestions** | Provided for downstream resolution agents or human editors |

---

## 5. Processing Pipeline

1. Ingest fully assembled content and all upstream decision logs
2. Scan for logical inconsistencies (factual, narrative, tone)
3. Cross-check ethical decision pathways for contradiction
4. Analyze policy conflicts across jurisdictional and organizational layers
5. Score and classify each detected issue
6. Generate conflict annotations and resolution suggestions
7. Escalate or block output if needed based on severity
8. Forward adjusted content to GEPDE for final ethics validation

---

## 6. Conflict Severity Scoring Model

| Level | Example Impact |
| --- | --- |
| **Low** | Minor tone inconsistency or slight narrative drift |
| **Moderate** | Ethical policy contradiction with low-risk audience impact |
| **High** | Content violating multiple conflicting policies or legal constraints |
| **Critical** | Severe contradiction likely to cause harm, legal risk, or ethical breach |

---

## 7. Deployment Options

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Default Conflict Resolution Policies** | Conservative, Balanced, or Aggressive conflict response profiles |
| **Custom Organizational Conflict Handling Rules** | Allow enterprises to define their own resolution priorities |
| **Real-Time Risk Threshold Tuning** | Admins can adjust risk tolerance levels for contradiction detection |
| **Manual Override Pathways** | Human agents can override or approve flagged outputs if needed |

---

## 8. Governance Hooks

- Ethical contradiction frequency monitoring
- Multi-agent or human review for all high-severity conflicts
- Periodic system-wide contradiction pattern analysis
- Detailed audit logs for all contradiction detection and resolution actions

---

## 9. Example Use Case Scenarios

| Scenario | ECCDE Action |
| --- | --- |
| **AI writes both "we always support free speech" and "we may censor opinions" in the same output** | Flag as logical contradiction, suggest policy clarification |
| **Jurisdictional policy demands age-restricted content, but user settings allow full access** | Flag as policy conflict, escalate for human review |
| **Tone inconsistency between opening and closing statements** | Auto-adjust or suggest correction for tone alignment |
| **Conflicting cultural sensitivities for a global audience** | Trigger multi-agent resolution path to generate culturally neutral alternative |
| **Simultaneous ethical rule conflicts from different modules** | Score severity, apply organizational resolution rules, log decision |

---

## 10. Module Integration Points

| Module | Integration |
| --- | --- |
| **GEPDE** | Final ethics validator after contradiction detection pass |
| **CASF** | Supplies audience sensitivity metadata for conflict scoring |
| **ETLAE** | Provides tone and language decision data |
| **RHGL** | Supplies humor risk adjustments impacting consistency |
| **CCETL** | Provides cross-cultural policy conflict mapping |
| **kOS Global Audit Layer** | Archives all contradiction detection logs |

---

## 11. Future Roadmap

- AI-powered multi-turn contradiction prediction models
- Sentiment-aware contradiction detection for emotional consistency
- Automated cross-module policy reconciliation frameworks
- Ethical contradiction trend dashboards for governance teams
