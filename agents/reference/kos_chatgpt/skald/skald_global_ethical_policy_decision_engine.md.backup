# Skald Global Ethical Policy Decision Engine (GEPDE)

## Node Class: Skald (Communication & Expression)

## Module Phase: 14 â€“ Ethical Reasoning Layer

---

## 1. Overview
The Skald Global Ethical Policy Decision Engine (GEPDE) is a universal ethical reasoning module integrated into the Skald Node Class. It functions as a decision mediation and justification layer for all Skald agent outputs, across any content format: text, speech, visual media, educational materials, humor, narrative generation, translation, or multimodal communication.

This module enables Skald agents to align their generated outputs with configurable ethical, legal, cultural, and organizational guidelines while remaining agile, creative, and adaptive to diverse contexts.

## 2. Primary Functions

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Ethical Framework Ingestion** | Load, parse, and index ethical policies and guidelines (HIEROS Code, organizational standards, legal restrictions, etc). |
| **Contextual Ethical Evaluation** | Analyze incoming task context (user intent, content type, audience, jurisdiction, language, media format) and determine appropriate ethical checks. |
| **Conflict Resolution** | Detect conflicts between user requests and active ethical frameworks; provide decision justification or suggest ethical alternatives. |
| **Decision Justification Layer** | Attach machine-readable and human-readable ethical reasoning tags to all outgoing content. Logs include reasoning paths and ethical rule matches. |
| **Framework Flexibility** | Allow runtime switching between ethical policy sets (global defaults, user-defined frameworks, organizational codes). |
| **Transparency & Audit Logging** | Maintain a detailed ethics decision log for every action, including timestamps, rule IDs triggered, overrides, and final decision outcome. |
| **Real-time Override Handling** | Provide agents with controlled override pathways (subject to escalation or multi-agent approval flows for high-risk overrides). |
| **Ethical Error Handling** | Generate user-facing error messages or alternative solutions when a requested action is deemed unethical by the active policy. |

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 3.1 Module Inputs:
- **Content Draft (pre-output)**
- **User Intent Metadata**
- **Audience Profile Data**
- **Jurisdictional Context (locale, country, etc)**
- **Active Ethical Policy Set**
- **Historical Decision Logs (optional, for learning mode)**

### 3.2 Module Outputs:
- **Ethics-validated Content**
- **Ethical Reasoning Metadata Tags (machine-readable)**
- **Human-readable Explanation (optional)**
- **Audit Log Entry**
- **Conflict/Error Message (if blocked or flagged)**

### 3.3 Processing Flow:
1. **Receive Input Request and Contextual Metadata**
2. **Load Active Ethical Policy Set**
3. **Run Contextual Ethical Evaluation Pass**
4. **Trigger Rule Matching and Conflict Detection**
5. **Resolve Conflicts or Escalate**
6. **Generate Decision Log and Reasoning Tags**
7. **Release Approved Output or Block with Explanation**

## 4. Ethical Policy Data Model

| Data Layer | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Policy Set Metadata** | Version, Source, Effective Date |
| **Rule Definitions** | Unique ID, Rule Scope (Content Type, Jurisdiction, User Group) |
| **Condition Triggers** | Keyword matches, context patterns, output type restrictions |
| **Action Logic** | Allow, Block, Escalate, Modify, Annotate |
| **Decision Weighting** | For multi-rule evaluations where priorities exist |

---

## 5. Deployment and Configuration

| Configurable Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Default Policy Set** | HIEROS Code or custom default for each deployment |
| **User-Specific Policies** | Allow users to register their own ethical preferences (optional) |
| **Organizational Policies** | Load enterprise-specific ethical requirements |
| **Jurisdictional Policy Packs** | Regional legal or cultural filters |
| **Runtime Override Controls** | Enable or disable user override pathways |
| **Logging Modes** | Full, Minimal, or Off (not recommended) |

---

## 6. Governance and Oversight Hooks

- Multi-agent review triggers for flagged ethical conflicts
- Decision quorum logic for high-impact actions
- Optional human-in-the-loop approval stages
- Periodic self-audit and ethical drift detection mechanisms

---

## 7. Example Use Case Scenarios

| Scenario | GEPDE Action |
| --- | --- |
| **User requests harmful misinformation spread** | Block output, log event, explain ethical violation |
| **User asks for culturally sensitive humor** | Evaluate against cultural guidelines, offer modified humor options if needed |
| **Agent detects audience includes minors** | Trigger content appropriateness filter based on age group |
| **User requests override on blocked content** | Escalate to multi-agent review or human supervisor (configurable) |
| **Educational agent teaching sensitive history topic** | Attach context-driven disclaimers, balance sensitivity with factual accuracy |

---

## 8. Integration with Other Modules

| Module | Integration Point |
| --- | --- |
| **Skald Contextual Trigger Engine** | Provides user intent and audience context |
| **Skald Story Assembly Engine** | Receives ethics-approved output templates |
| **kOS Global Audit Layer** | Ingests decision logs for system-wide traceability |
| **HIEROS Ethical Framework Manager** | Supplies source policy data and updates |

---

## 9. Future Roadmap

- Agent self-learning for ethical decision refinement
- Sentiment-aware ethical risk modeling
- Cross-cultural ethical translation layer
- Federated policy governance for decentralized deployments
- Real-time user education modules for transparent ethics training
