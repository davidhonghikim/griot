# Skald Module Specification: Cross-Class Orchestration Adapter (CCOA)

## Module Name
**Skald Cross-Class Orchestration Adapter (CCOA)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Skald Cross-Class Orchestration Adapter (CCOA) enables Skald to interoperate and orchestrate workflows that span across different kOS Node Classes (e.g., Discovery, Guardian, Labor, Sensor nodes). It acts as a translation and coordination layer for cross-class task sequencing, data sharing, and resource handoff.

## Purpose
To enable multi-node-class orchestration where a single high-level Skald workflow may involve Discovery queries, Guardian decisions, Labor executions, or Sensor-triggered inputs in a unified, trackable execution flow.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Cross-Class Workflow Initiation
- **Multi-Class Workflow Triggering:** Allow Skald workflows to trigger tasks in other kOS Node Classes.
- **Inter-Class Input/Output Mapping:** Translate Skald workflow outputs into input schemas for other classes.
- **Response Handling:** Collect and normalize outputs from other Node Classes for further Skald workflow processing.

### 2. Orchestration Coordination
- **Cross-Class Task Sequencing:** Manage execution order and dependencies between multi-class tasks.
- **Parallel Execution Support:** Allow concurrent cross-class operations where appropriate.
- **Timeouts and Error Escalation:** Define SLA and error handling rules per class interaction.

### 3. Message and Data Translation
- **Class-Specific Adapters:** Use predefined schemas or pluggable adapters for each Node Class (Discovery, Guardian, etc.).
- **Semantic Data Mapping:** Normalize data terminology and formats between Node Classes.
- **Inter-Class Workflow State Tracking:** Maintain a unified state model for multi-class workflow progress.

### 4. Security and Access Control
- **Inter-Class Auth Policies:** Enforce authentication and authorization for cross-class calls.
- **Data Governance:** Apply Skald ethical and governance filters on all inter-class data exchanges.
- **Audit Trail:** Log all cross-class orchestration actions in ALC.

### 5. Performance and Reliability
- **Asynchronous Task Coordination:** Allow non-blocking orchestration.
- **Failure Recovery:** Support fallback paths if a target Node Class fails to respond.
- **Retry Logic:** Configurable retry policies for cross-class task calls.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Latency:** Target <150ms orchestration overhead per cross-class call.
- **Scalability:** Support hundreds of concurrent cross-class orchestration flows.
- **Extensibility:** Allow future kOS Node Classes to integrate seamlessly.
- **Resilience:** Fault-tolerant orchestration with rollback support.

## Data Flow Diagram (Textual)
1. **Skald Workflow Step → CCOA Adapter Layer → Target Node Class API/Interface → Target Node Class Execution → CCOA Response Handler → Skald Workflow Continuation**

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** Skald Workflow Orchestrator (SWO), Runtime Scheduler.
- **Output Interfaces:** External Node Class APIs (Discovery, Guardian, Labor, Sensor, etc.), Logging Systems.

## Configuration Options
- **Node Class Target List:** Configurable.
- **Timeouts Per Class:** Customizable.
- **Inter-Class Error Handling Mode:** Fail-fast / Retry / Skip.
- **Audit Logging Level:** Minimal / Verbose.

## Example Use Cases
- Triggering a Discovery Node semantic search as part of a Skald summarization workflow.
- Invoking Guardian Node ethical validation before releasing sensitive narrative outputs.
- Handing off content generation results to a Labor Node for external action execution.
- Collecting sensor data from Sensor Nodes during real-time storytelling.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **Custom Node Class Connectors:** For future kOS Node Classes.
- **Dynamic Workflow Mapping Rules:** For runtime decision making.
- **Multi-Class Workflow Visualization Plugins:** Future support for dashboard visualization.

## Testing and Validation Plan
- Cross-class call latency tests.
- Task sequencing correctness validation.
- Error path injection tests.
- Audit log integrity verification.

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **Skald Workflow Orchestrator (SWO)**
- **Skald Global Ethical Interoperability Gateway (GEIG)**
- **Audit Logging and Compliance Engine (ALC)**

## Future Enhancements
- AI-driven cross-class orchestration optimization.
- Visual cross-class workflow designer.
- SLA-aware multi-class execution policies.
- Federated inter-class trust scoring.
