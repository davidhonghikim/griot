# Skald Module Specification: External Event Stream Ingestor (EESI)

## Module Name
**Skald External Event Stream Ingestor (EESI)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Skald External Event Stream Ingestor (EESI) enables Skald to consume, process, and react to continuous external event streams from third-party sources, IoT devices, partner systems, or external kOS nodes. It supports real-time, batch, and historical event ingestion modes.

## Purpose
To provide a scalable and resilient framework for ingesting external event data streams, applying policy-based filtering, transforming incoming data into Skald-compatible formats, and triggering relevant Skald workflows based on incoming event content.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Stream Source Support
- **Streaming Protocols:** Support for Kafka, MQTT, AMQP, WebSocket, and HTTP Streaming.
- **Pull and Push Modes:** Allow Skald to both subscribe (pull) and receive pushed events.
- **Batch Ingestion Support:** Allow bulk ingestion of historical event logs.
- **Third-Party Event Broker Integration:** Support external brokers (e.g., Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ).

### 2. Event Parsing and Normalization
- **Format Adapters:** Support JSON, Avro, Protobuf, XML, and custom formats.
- **Field Mapping and Normalization:** Translate incoming event schemas to Skald’s internal event structure.
- **Event Metadata Augmentation:** Add source metadata, ingestion timestamps, and trust scores.

### 3. Filtering and Policy Enforcement
- **Content-Based Filtering:** Allow inclusion/exclusion rules based on event content.
- **Rate Limiting:** Throttle ingest rates to prevent overload.
- **Source Authentication and Verification:** Validate trusted event sources.
- **Ethical Screening:** Apply HIEROS Code compliance checks on incoming event content.

### 4. Triggered Workflow Execution
- **Event-to-Workflow Mapping:** Route specific event types to predefined Skald workflows.
- **Dynamic Trigger Rules:** Allow runtime update of event-to-workflow mappings.
- **Multi-Event Aggregation:** Support composite triggers that depend on multiple correlated events.

### 5. Reliability and Resilience
- **Backpressure Handling:** Apply flow control to handle bursts of incoming events.
- **Dead Letter Queues:** Route problematic events for manual inspection.
- **At-Least-Once Delivery Guarantee:** Ensure event processing reliability.
- **Replay Support:** Allow historical replay of stored event streams.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Latency:** Sub-100ms event ingestion-to-workflow trigger time.
- **Scalability:** Support millions of events per day.
- **Extensibility:** Pluggable ingestion adapters for new protocols or formats.
- **Durability:** Persistent queueing for unprocessed events.

## Data Flow Diagram (Textual)

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** External Event Streams (Kafka, MQTT, WebSocket, etc.).
- **Output Interfaces:** Skald Workflow Orchestrator (SWO), Audit Logging (ALC), Admin Dashboards (for event stats).

## Configuration Options
- **Enabled Event Sources:** Configurable per deployment.
- **Ingestion Rate Limits:** Per source.
- **Trigger Mapping Rules:** Dynamic, per event type.
- **Backpressure Policy:** Drop / Queue / Slow Source.

## Example Use Cases
- Ingesting IoT sensor data for real-time narrative generation.
- Triggering sentiment analysis workflows based on social media event streams.
- Processing partner system notifications for workflow updates.
- Batch importing historical event logs for forensic narrative reconstruction.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **Custom Event Source Plugins:** For proprietary systems.
- **Dynamic Filter Loader:** Runtime update of filtering rules.
- **Third-Party Event Schema Loaders:** Import external event schemas.

## Testing and Validation Plan
- High-volume event ingestion stress tests.
- Event-to-workflow mapping accuracy tests.
- Source authentication validation.
- Failure and retry path testing.

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **Skald Workflow Orchestrator (SWO)**
- **Skald Global Ethical Interoperability Gateway (GEIG)**
- **Audit Logging and Compliance Engine (ALC)**

## Future Enhancements
- AI-based event prioritization.
- Predictive event trigger pre-loading.
- Federated event source trust scoring.
- Streaming analytics dashboard integration.
