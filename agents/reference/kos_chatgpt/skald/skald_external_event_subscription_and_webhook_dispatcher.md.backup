# Skald Module Specification: External Event Subscription and Webhook Dispatcher (EESWD)

## Module Name
**Skald External Event Subscription and Webhook Dispatcher (EESWD)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Skald External Event Subscription and Webhook Dispatcher (EESWD) provides a subscription-based event streaming and outbound webhook notification system for external clients and systems. It allows third-party consumers to subscribe to Skald event topics and receive real-time updates, notifications, or data payloads via HTTP webhooks or streaming APIs.

## Purpose
To enable real-time, event-driven integration between Skald and external consumers by supporting publish-subscribe patterns, outbound webhooks, and external event stream delivery mechanisms.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Event Subscription Management
- **Topic-Based Subscription Model:** Allow external clients to subscribe to specific event categories (e.g., workflow completion, SLA breach, incident alerts).
- **Filterable Subscriptions:** Support filtering by workflow ID, event severity, tenant, or data type.
- **Subscription API:** Provide REST API for subscription creation, update, and deletion.
- **Webhook Verification:** Use challenge-response handshake for webhook target validation.

### 2. Outbound Webhook Dispatching
- **Payload Formatting:** Allow JSON, XML, or custom payload formats per subscription.
- **Retry and Backoff Policies:** Retry failed webhook deliveries with exponential backoff.
- **Signature Headers:** Attach cryptographic signatures to payloads for recipient validation.
- **Delivery Rate Limiting:** Throttle delivery rates per subscriber to prevent overload.

### 3. Streaming API Support (Optional Future Mode)
- **WebSocket Event Stream:** Allow long-lived connections for real-time event delivery.
- **gRPC Event Streaming (Optional):** For high-performance subscribers.
- **Per-Client Event Throttling:** Prevent flooding slow subscribers.

### 4. Monitoring and Alerting
- **Webhook Delivery Dashboard:** Show delivery status, latencies, and failure rates per subscriber.
- **Dead Letter Queue:** Capture undeliverable events for manual retry or inspection.
- **Subscription Health Monitoring:** Alert admins if subscribers experience persistent failures.

### 5. Security and Compliance
- **API Key or OAuth2 Authentication:** For subscription management API.
- **IP Whitelisting for Webhook Targets:** Limit outbound deliveries to authorized target ranges.
- **Payload Encryption Support:** Optionally encrypt webhook payloads.
- **Audit Logging:** Log all subscription changes and delivery events into CALE.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Low Latency:** Sub-200ms average event dispatch time for active subscribers.
- **High Availability:** Redundant dispatcher workers with failover.
- **Scalability:** Support thousands of concurrent subscribers.
- **Resilience:** Durable event queues to survive node restarts.

## Data Flow Diagram (Textual)
1. **Internal Event Generation → EESWD Subscription Filter → Payload Formatter → Webhook Dispatcher / Streaming Service → External Client → Delivery Confirmation / Retry Queue → Audit Log (CALE)**

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** All Skald Modules via kOS Event Bus.
- **Output Interfaces:** External HTTP/S Webhook Targets, Streaming API Consumers, Audit Logging (CALE).

## Configuration Options
- **Subscription TTLs:** Time-to-live for inactive subscriptions.
- **Retry Policies:** Global and per-subscriber overrides.
- **Payload Format Defaults:** Per topic.
- **Rate Limits:** Per subscriber.

## Example Use Cases
- Notifying a partner system when a workflow completes.
- Streaming SLA breach events to an external SIEM.
- Delivering output artifact links via webhook for partner retrieval.
- Allowing external dashboards to consume real-time event streams.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **Custom Payload Formatter Plugins:** For partner-specific data formats.
- **External Broker Connector:** Forward Skald events to external message brokers (Kafka, RabbitMQ).
- **Dynamic Topic Loader:** Add new event topics at runtime.

## Testing and Validation Plan
- Subscription lifecycle API tests.
- Webhook delivery success rate benchmarking.
- Failure recovery and retry scenario tests.
- Payload signature validation correctness.

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **Audit Logging and Compliance Engine (ALC)**
- **Metrics and Telemetry Visualization Engine (MTVE)**
- **Admin Control Panel (ACP)**

## Future Enhancements
- Support for gRPC event streams.
- AI-driven subscriber health scoring.
- Real-time subscription metrics export.
- Custom retry logic scripting per subscriber.
