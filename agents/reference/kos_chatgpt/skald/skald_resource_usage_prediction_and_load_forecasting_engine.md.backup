# Skald Module Specification: Resource Usage Prediction and Load Forecasting Engine (RUPLFE)

## Module Name
**Skald Resource Usage Prediction and Load Forecasting Engine (RUPLFE)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Skald Resource Usage Prediction and Load Forecasting Engine (RUPLFE) uses AI/ML models to predict future resource usage trends and incoming workload levels. RUPLFE enables proactive scaling, resource reservation, and system-wide readiness for high-demand scenarios.

## Purpose
To anticipate workload surges, minimize latency under load, and optimize Skald system resource allocation ahead of time using predictive analytics on historical usage patterns and external signals.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Data Collection and Feature Engineering
- **Historical Metrics Collection:** Ingest CPU, memory, I/O, network, and workflow execution metrics over time.
- **Event Correlation:** Incorporate external signals (e.g., scheduled partner API loads, calendar events).
- **User Behavior Trends:** Analyze peak usage windows, user activity cycles, and workflow frequency patterns.

### 2. Prediction Models
- **Time-Series Forecasting Models:** ARIMA, Prophet, or ML-based predictors for resource demand forecasting.
- **Load Spike Detection:** Flag predicted near-term demand spikes.
- **Capacity Planning Projections:** Provide longer-term resource usage forecasts (daily, weekly, monthly horizons).

### 3. Forecast Output and Visualization
- **Forecast API:** Serve predictions via REST API for other modules to consume.
- **Dashboard Visualization:** Display upcoming load forecasts and historical usage patterns in DVL.
- **Alert Triggers:** Generate alerts for predicted SLA breach risks due to forecasted load.

### 4. Integration with Runtime Systems
- **Scheduler Input:** Provide load forecasts to Skald Runtime Scheduler for pre-scheduling and resource allocation.
- **Auto-Scaler Hooks:** Support integration with external auto-scaling frameworks for infrastructure adjustments.
- **Preemptive Tuning:** Trigger WPOE and SQL modules to adjust settings before high-load periods.

### 5. Model Training and Updates
- **Continuous Model Retraining:** Refresh models periodically with latest telemetry data.
- **Admin-Driven Retraining Trigger:** Allow manual retraining from ACP.
- **Model Version Control:** Track deployed forecasting model versions.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Latency:** Forecast API response time <200ms.
- **Scalability:** Support forecasting for hundreds of metrics across thousands of workflows.
- **Accuracy:** Target >90% accuracy for short-term load predictions.
- **Resilience:** Fallback to last-known-good forecast if model failure occurs.

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** Usage Metrics (UMAC), Resource Utilization Monitor (RUM), External Event Streams (optional).
- **Output Interfaces:** Runtime Scheduler (SRS), Admin Dashboards (DVL), SLA Enforcement Layer (SQL), Notification Systems.

## Configuration Options
- **Forecast Horizon:** Short-term / Mid-term / Long-term.
- **Model Type:** Time-Series / ML-Based / Hybrid.
- **Retraining Frequency:** Scheduled / On-Demand.
- **Alert Thresholds:** Customizable per metric.

## Example Use Cases
- Pre-scaling node capacity before a predicted API traffic spike.
- Adjusting SLA enforcement limits during anticipated load bursts.
- Notifying admins about projected resource shortages.
- Forecasting monthly infrastructure needs for budget planning.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **Custom Prediction Models:** Allow data scientists to deploy custom forecasting algorithms.
- **External Data Source Plugins:** Ingest external signals like market trends or calendar feeds.
- **Dynamic Retraining Triggers:** Based on detected data drift or pattern shifts.

## Testing and Validation Plan
- Historical forecast accuracy benchmarking.
- Model drift detection tests.
- Real-time load spike simulation tests.
- SLA risk prediction validation.

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **Usage Metrics and Analytics Collector (UMAC)**
- **Resource Utilization Monitor (RUM)**
- **Admin Control Panel (ACP)**
- **Dashboard and Visualization Layer (DVL)**

## Future Enhancements
- AI-driven auto-scaler integration.
- Multi-node cluster-wide forecasting.
- External business signal ingestion (e.g., sales data).
- Reinforcement learning for adaptive resource planning.
