# Skald Module Specification: SLA Compliance and Risk Dashboard (SCRD)

## Module Name
**Skald SLA Compliance and Risk Dashboard (SCRD)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Skald SLA Compliance and Risk Dashboard (SCRD) provides real-time and historical visualization of Service Level Agreement (SLA) performance, breach incidents, risk forecasts, and mitigation actions across the Skald system. It allows administrators to monitor SLA health, analyze risk trends, and take proactive corrective actions.

## Purpose
To give Skald operators and compliance teams clear, actionable visibility into SLA adherence, near-term breach risks, and historical SLA violation patterns across workflows, nodes, and tenants.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Real-Time SLA Compliance Monitoring
- **Live SLA Health Indicators:** Display current SLA adherence status for key metrics (latency, uptime, error rate, etc.).
- **Workflow-Level SLA Tracking:** Monitor SLA status per active workflow.
- **Node-Level SLA Performance:** Show SLA compliance rates by node or cluster.

### 2. Risk Forecasting and Alerts
- **Near-Term Breach Risk Scores:** Visualize risk probability for each workflow and system component (from SLABPRM).
- **Forecast Trend Charts:** Display breach risk trends over time.
- **Breach Probability Heatmaps:** Highlight workflows or modules with highest near-term breach likelihood.
- **Pre-Breach Alerts:** Trigger notifications when risk thresholds are crossed.

### 3. SLA Breach History and Analysis
- **Breach Incident Logs:** List all past SLA breach events with timestamp, workflow ID, and root cause.
- **Breach Cause Categorization:** Classify breaches by resource bottleneck, config issue, external dependency, etc.
- **Mitigation Action Tracking:** Log what mitigation actions were taken and their outcomes.

### 4. SLA Reporting and Export
- **SLA Compliance Reports:** Generate weekly, monthly, or custom-period reports on SLA adherence.
- **Breach Rate Dashboards:** Visualize SLA violation rates over time by workflow type, module, or tenant.
- **Export Options:** CSV, JSON, PDF for compliance submission.

### 5. Integration with Other Modules
- **SLABPRM Data Feeds:** Use real-time risk scores from the SLA Breach Prediction Engine.
- **WPOE and AWRE Control Hooks:** Allow admins to trigger workflow tuning or rerouting actions from within the dashboard.
- **Alert System Sync:** Feed breach alerts into Admin Dashboard notification channels.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **UI Latency:** SLA dashboards refresh within 1 second.
- **Scalability:** Track SLA status for thousands of concurrent workflows.
- **Extensibility:** Support for new SLA types as system expands.
- **Compliance Ready:** Report generation must meet external audit standards.

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** SLA Breach Prediction and Risk Mitigation Layer (SLABPRM), Workflow Orchestrator (SWO), Audit Logging and Compliance Engine (ALC).
- **Output Interfaces:** Admin Dashboard (DVL), Notification Systems, External Reporting Tools.

## Configuration Options
- **Risk Thresholds:** Customizable per SLA type.
- **Breach Categorization Rules:** Editable by admins.
- **Report Scheduling:** Automated weekly, monthly, or on-demand.
- **Dashboard Layout Settings:** Per-user customization.

## Example Use Cases
- Monitoring real-time SLA risk levels during a traffic surge.
- Investigating root causes of SLA breaches from the past week.
- Exporting SLA compliance reports for an external audit.
- Triggering WPOE tuning based on rising SLA risk trends.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **Custom SLA Type Support:** Add new SLA dimensions over time.
- **External Compliance Platform Integration:** Auto-submit SLA reports.
- **AI Risk Trend Analysis Plugins:** For predictive SLA health scoring.

## Testing and Validation Plan
- Risk score visualization accuracy testing.
- SLA breach reporting correctness validation.
- UI latency stress tests under load.
- Mitigation trigger flow validation.

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **SLA Breach Prediction and Risk Mitigation Layer (SLABPRM)**
- **Workflow Orchestrator (SWO)**
- **Audit Logging and Compliance Engine (ALC)**
- **Admin Control Panel (ACP)**

## Future Enhancements
- AI-driven SLA risk forecasting.
- Real-time SLA heatmap visualization.
- User-configurable SLA dashboards.
- Automated SLA breach mitigation recommendations.
