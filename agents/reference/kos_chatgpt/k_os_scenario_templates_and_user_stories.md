# kOS Scenario Templates and User Stories

## Overview
The **kOS Scenario Templates and User Stories (STUS)** provide standardized, reusable blueprints for defining real-world workflows, user journeys, and multi-agent interactions within the kOS ecosystem. These templates allow developers, operators, and users to design, simulate, and execute agent-based scenarios across any Node Class configuration.

## Scenario Template Structure

| Section                | Description                             |
|------------------- |----------------------------------- |
| Scenario Name        | Human-readable name for the scenario |
| Scenario ID          | Unique system identifier           |
| Target Node Classes  | Which Node Classes are involved   |
| Trigger Conditions   | Events that initiate the scenario |
| Agent Roles          | Specific agent responsibilities    |
| Workflow Steps       | Sequential or parallel task list  |
| Success Criteria     | How scenario completion is measured |
| Ethics Impact Rating | Low / Medium / High                |
| Rollback Plan        | Recovery actions if scenario fails |

## Example Scenario Templates

### ðŸ“‹ **Scenario: Ethics Violation Response (Governance Tier)**

| Field                | Value                             |
|------------------- |------------------------------- |
| Scenario Name        | Ethics Violation Response        |
| Scenario ID          | `gov-ethics-001`                 |
| Target Node Classes  | Junzi, Sentinel, Sachem          |
| Trigger Condition    | Ethics filter triggers a high-severity violation |
| Agent Roles          | Junzi (Ethics Review), Sentinel (Node Quarantine), Sachem (Governance Decision) |
| Workflow Steps       | 1. Log violation  2. Quarantine node  3. Notify governance layer  4. Conduct ethics audit  5. Determine resolution |
| Success Criteria     | Violation contained, user notified, governance decision recorded |
| Ethics Impact Rating | High                             |
| Rollback Plan        | Release quarantined node if false positive detected |

### ðŸ“‹ **Scenario: Skill Deployment Across Edge Nodes (Service Tier)**

| Field                | Value                             |
|------------------- |------------------------------- |
| Scenario Name        | Skill Rollout: Edge Deployment  |
| Scenario ID          | `svc-deploy-005`                |
| Target Node Classes  | Skald, Tohunga, Ronin          |
| Trigger Condition    | New skill package uploaded to Skill Registry |
| Agent Roles          | Orchestrator (Deployment Scheduling), Node-local agents (Skill Loader), JUNZI (Ethics Screening) |
| Workflow Steps       | 1. Ethics pre-check  2. Deploy skill to targeted nodes  3. Run validation test  4. Update deployment status |
| Success Criteria     | Skill successfully installed and validated on 90% of target nodes |
| Ethics Impact Rating | Medium                          |
| Rollback Plan        | Uninstall skill on failed nodes, report errors |

### ðŸ“‹ **Scenario: User Onboarding Flow (Foundation Tier)**

| Field                | Value                             |
|------------------- |------------------------------- |
| Scenario Name        | First-Time User Onboarding       |
| Scenario ID          | `found-onboard-002`              |
| Target Node Classes  | Griot, Skald, Sage               |
| Trigger Condition    | New user account creation        |
| Agent Roles          | Griot (Contextual Memory), Skald (User Guidance), Sage (Decision Support) |
| Workflow Steps       | 1. Greet user  2. Collect preferences  3. Explain kOS basics  4. Recommend initial agents to activate |
| Success Criteria     | User completes onboarding flow with consent forms signed |
| Ethics Impact Rating | Low                              |
| Rollback Plan        | Restart onboarding if user drops session |

## Scenario Storage Format

| Format Option         | Notes                                      |
|------------------ |------------------------------------- |
| YAML Templates     | Preferred for declarative storage and CI/CD integration |
| JSON Objects       | API-friendly export format               |

## User Story Development Guidelines

| Principle               | Description                                |
|------------------- |------------------------------------ |
| Node Class Awareness | Tailor user stories to relevant Node Class functionality |
| Multi-Agent Flow      | Clearly map how agents interact within the story |
| Ethical Considerations | Document potential ethics risks per story  |
| Failure Mode Handling | Include recovery paths in every story      |
| Outcome-Focused       | Frame stories around user or system goals  |
