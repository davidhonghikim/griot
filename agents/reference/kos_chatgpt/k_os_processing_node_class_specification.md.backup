# kOS Processing Node Class Specification

## Overview
The **kOS Processing Node Class** functions as the computational and analytical workhorse of the kOS ecosystem. Processing Nodes are designed to handle intensive data transformations, complex computations, AI model inference, batch processing, and large-scale data analysis workflows.

Processing Nodes act as the system's "cortex processors," enabling everything from statistical modeling to deep learning tasks within the ecosystem.
