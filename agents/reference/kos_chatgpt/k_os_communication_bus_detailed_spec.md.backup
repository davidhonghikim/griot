# kOS Communication Bus Detailed Specification

## Overview
The **kOS Communication Bus** (KCB) is the unified, multi-protocol, low-latency event and message transport layer for all inter-agent communication within the kOS ecosystem. It enables agents, nodes, and modules to exchange commands, context, state updates, data streams, and event triggers in real time or near-real time.

## Channel Types

| Channel Type       | Description                                    |
|------------------ |---------------------------------------------- |
| Broadcast          | Sent to all active agents                     |
| Multicast          | Sent to selected group of agents (by Node Class or role) |
| Unicast            | Direct point-to-point agent message           |

## Message Encryption and Security

| Layer                 | Details                                          |
|--------------------- |----------------------------------------------- |
| TLS Encryption        | For all external and inter-node connections    |
| Agent Authentication  | Agents must sign and verify all outgoing messages |
| Payload Signing       | Optional but recommended for high-risk payloads |
| Ethics Enforcement    | JUNZI pre-transmission ethical filter           |

## Runtime Monitoring and Metrics

| Metric                    | Description                                |
|------------------------- |---------------------------------------- |
| Throughput (msg/sec)      | Number of messages transmitted per second |
| Latency                  | Time taken for message delivery          |
| Error Rate               | Failed or dropped messages               |
| Ethics Violation Rate    | Filtered or blocked unethical messages   |
| Channel Saturation       | Queue backlog or congestion indicators   |
