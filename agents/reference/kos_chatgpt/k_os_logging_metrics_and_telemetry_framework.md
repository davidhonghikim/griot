# kOS Logging, Metrics, and Telemetry Framework

## Overview
The **kOS Logging, Metrics, and Telemetry Framework (LMTF)** provides a unified, extensible, and ethically compliant system for capturing, storing, querying, and visualizing logs, performance metrics, and system telemetry across the entire kOS ecosystem.

This layer powers system observability, ethical auditing, troubleshooting, performance monitoring, and adaptive optimization.

## Core Components

| Component              | Purpose                                  |
|-------------------- |------------------------------------ |
| Logging Engine         | Capture structured, timestamped logs from all agents and nodes |
| Metrics Collector       | Monitor system, agent, and node performance metrics |
| Telemetry Streamer      | Stream live agent and node telemetry for dashboards and triggers |
| Ethics Audit Log Filter | Inject JUNZI ethics events and violations into logs |
| Storage Backends        | Persist logs and metrics to local or distributed databases |

|---------------- |-------------------------------------- |
| Action Logs         | Agent actions, task executions        |
| Error Logs          | Runtime exceptions, agent failures    |
| Context Logs        | Environmental and contextual snapshots |
| Ethics Logs         | Pre-action filters, violations, overrides |
| Deployment Logs      | Agent deployment and scaling activities |
| API Access Logs      | External API calls and responses     |

|------------------ |----------------------------------- |
| Local File Logs     | Offline or edge deployments         |
| Time-Series Databases | Prometheus, InfluxDB, or similar for metric storage |
| Distributed Log Stores | ElasticSearch, OpenSearch, or Loki   |
| Blockchain Ledger (Optional) | Immutable, tamper-proof audit trails |

---

## Querying and Visualization

| Tool/Method          | Description                           |
|------------------ |----------------------------------- |
| PromQL / InfluxQL Queries | For time-series metric analysis    |
| JSON/Regex Queries | For unstructured log searches       |
| Grafana Dashboards  | For real-time metrics and system health views |
| CLI Query Tools      | Command-line retrieval and filtering |
| Ethics Violation Heatmaps | Visualize frequency and location of ethical issues |

---

## Ethics-Integrated Logging Policies

| Policy Type          | Enforcement Action                           |
|------------------ |----------------------------------------- |
| Data Minimization    | Log only required and ethically approved data |
| Ethics Tagging        | Every log entry includes ethical classification flags |
| Access Control        | Sensitive logs restricted by RBAC and Node Class privileges |
| Audit Immutability    | Critical logs stored in tamper-evident storage |
| Consent-Aware Logging | Respect user data privacy and consent settings |

---

## Metrics API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                 | Purpose                         |
|------ |---------------------- |----------------------------- |
| GET   | `/metrics/agent/{agent_id}` | Retrieve live agent metrics    |
| GET   | `/metrics/node/{node_id}` | Node resource and agent counts |
| GET   | `/metrics/system`        | Global system metrics          |
| GET   | `/logs`                  | Query recent logs              |
| POST  | `/logs/search`           | Execute advanced log queries   |
