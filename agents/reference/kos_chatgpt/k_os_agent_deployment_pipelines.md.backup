# kOS Agent Deployment Pipelines

## Overview
The **kOS Agent Deployment Pipeline** defines the standardized end-to-end lifecycle for packaging, testing, deploying, and updating any agent within the kOS ecosystem. It ensures agents remain modular, version-controlled, secure, and auditable from development to production.

## Pipeline Stages

| Stage                      | Purpose                                              |
|--------------------------- |----------------------------------------------------- |
| Source Control             | Store agent code, configs, and metadata in Git or equivalent version control system |
| Build Phase                | Compile, package, and containerize the agent (if needed) |
| Static Code Analysis       | Run linting, formatting, security checks, and dependency vulnerability scans |
| Unit Testing               | Execute predefined unit tests for core agent functionality |
| Integration Testing        | Validate agent behavior in simulated multi-agent scenarios |
| Ethics Pre-Screen (Optional Pre-Deployment JUNZI Audit) | Static ethics rule checks before deployment |
| Containerization (Optional) | Package agent into container format (e.g., Docker, OCI) for isolated deployment |
| Artifact Storage           | Upload packaged agent (binary or container) into Artifact Repository |
| Deployment Approval Gate   | Manual or automated validation before rollout |
| Staging Deployment         | Deploy to non-production test environment with live system interfaces |
| Performance and Load Testing | Ensure the agent meets latency, throughput, and resource usage SLAs |
| Ethics Runtime Test        | Run JUNZI dynamic behavior tests under controlled inputs |
| Production Deployment      | Deploy agent into live production environment |
| Post-Deployment Monitoring | Use logs, metrics, and probes to confirm healthy operation |

---

## Deployment Modes

| Mode             | Description                         |
|---------------- |------------------------------------ |
| Cold Deployment | Full restart of agent services      |
| Rolling Update  | Sequential agent updates with zero downtime |
| Blue/Green      | Deploy to parallel environment and switch traffic |
| Canary Release  | Gradual rollout to a subset of nodes/users |
| Hot Reload      | Live skill/module swap without downtime |

---

## Artifact Types

| Artifact Type    | Example Output                          |
|----------------- |--------------------------------------- |
| Source Package   | Compressed agent source code archive   |
| Container Image  | Docker / OCI compatible image          |
| Binary Release   | Precompiled standalone executable      |
| Skill Bundle     | JSON/YAML + embedded Python skill file |

---

## Deployment Targets

| Target                | Notes                                 |
|---------------------- |------------------------------------- |
| Local Node            | For offline or on-device deployments |
| Private Mesh Network  | LoRa, WiFi mesh, or decentralized peer network |
| Cloud Instance        | Public cloud VMs or container services |
| Edge Devices          | IoT, mobile, or low-resource devices |

---

## Rollback Strategy

| Failure Scenario        | Rollback Action                     |
|----------------------- |----------------------------------- |
| Ethics Violation        | Immediate agent disable, revert to last good state |
| Functional Failure      | Automatic reversion to previous agent version |
| Performance Regression  | Rollback with notification to orchestrator |

---

## Deployment Security Controls

- All deployments must:
  - Pass static and dynamic security scans
  - Be signed and hash-verified before execution
  - Be auditable via deployment logs and change history

---

## Post-Deployment Monitoring Metrics

| Metric                    | Purpose                      |
|-------------------------- |----------------------------- |
| Uptime / Heartbeats       | Ensure continuous agent operation |
| Action Latency            | Track responsiveness        |
| Resource Consumption      | CPU, memory, bandwidth usage |
| Ethics Violation Rate     | Monitor ethical rule breaches |
| Error Rate                | Track runtime failures       |

---

## Future Extensions

- Auto-healing deployments
- Deployment templating
- A/B skill testing across agents
- AI-driven deployment optimization

---

This document defines the complete deployment lifecycle for all agents operating under kOS. All future deployment automation tools must adhere to this standard.
