# kOS Skald Format Conversion and Multi-Modal Output Engine (SFCMOE)

## Overview
The **kOS Skald Format Conversion and Multi-Modal Output Engine (SFCMOE)** is responsible for transforming Skald-generated content into a wide variety of output formats and delivery media. It ensures that every message, alert, or system output is appropriately structured, formatted, and packaged for its target channel and device.

SFCMOE enables seamless communication across text, audio, data payloads, visual dashboards, API calls, and more.

## 1. Core Responsibilities

- Data format conversion
- Media type transformation (text-to-speech, text-to-visual)
- Output packaging for target channels
- Multi-modal content generation
- Ethical format filtering (via GEIG)

---

## 2. Supported Output Formats

- **Text:** Markdown, HTML, Plaintext, JSON, XML
- **Audio:** Text-to-Speech (TTS) generated audio files or streams (WAV, MP3, Opus)
- **Visual:** Graphs, charts, infographics (SVG, PNG, etc.)
- **API Payloads:** REST/JSON, gRPC
- **Streaming:** WebSocket messages, Pub/Sub payloads
- **Binary:** Optional for special agent-to-agent binary communication

---

## 3. Conversion Pipelines

### 3.1 Format Selection Engine
- Determines target format based on:
  - Audience profile (from SATRE)
  - Channel capabilities
  - User/system preferences
  - Ethical output constraints

### 3.2 Content Renderer
- Applies formatting templates
- Embeds dynamic data variables
- Supports multi-language rendering with SLTLE integration

### 3.3 Multi-Modal Layer
- Supports simultaneous generation of multiple output types from a single message source
- Handles synchronization across formats (e.g., audio + text + API)

### 3.4 Output Packaging
- Adds necessary headers, metadata, and transmission-ready structures
- Supports streaming and non-streaming delivery modes

## 4. API Endpoints

- `/sfcmoe/convert`
- `/sfcmoe/output/preview`
- `/sfcmoe/output/dispatch`
- `/sfcmoe/format/list`
- `/sfcmoe/multimodal/generate`

---

## 5. Performance and Scaling

- Multi-threaded conversion pipelines
- GPU acceleration for media rendering tasks
- Output caching for frequently requested conversions
- Support for bulk/batch processing

---

## 6. Ethical and Security Controls

- GEIG filtering on media type selection (e.g., blocking sensitive content from being converted to public API payloads)
- Content watermarking for auditable outputs
- Size and rate limits on large media conversions
- Opt-in settings for sensitive output modes (e.g., speech synthesis)

---

## 7. Advanced Features

- AI-based voice synthesis tuning for audio outputs
- Dynamic visual theme adjustment for user-specific dashboard outputs
- Cross-format consistency validation
- Accessibility format support (screen-reader-friendly, closed captions, etc.)

---

## Conclusion
The **kOS Skald Format Conversion and Multi-Modal Output Engine (SFCMOE)** ensures that every Skald-generated message can reach its audience in the most appropriate, accessible, and ethical format—whether text, audio, visual, or machine-consumable data—across the entire kOS ecosystem.
