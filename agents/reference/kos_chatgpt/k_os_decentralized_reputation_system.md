# kOS Decentralized Reputation System

## Overview
The **kOS Decentralized Reputation System (DRS)** provides a transparent, tamper-resistant, and ethics-aware scoring framework for tracking trust, performance, and ethical standing of agents, nodes, and users across the kOS ecosystem. It integrates with the Tokidao economic layer, JUNZI ethics engine, and kOS telemetry systems to enable trust-weighted decision making at all layers.

## Core Functions

| Function                  | Purpose                                      |
|-------------------- |------------------------------------------ |
| Trust Scoring          | Calculate dynamic trust scores for agents, nodes, and users based on behavior history |
| Ethics Compliance Weighting | Penalize or reward entities based on ethics adherence |
| Performance Metrics Integration | Factor reliability, uptime, and completion rates into reputation scores |
| Peer Voting (Optional) | Allow federated nodes or users to endorse or downvote entities |
| Reputation-Based Access Control | Gate access to sensitive actions or roles based on trust scores |
| Reputation Ledger       | Maintain an immutable, decentralized record of reputation history |

## Reputation Dimensions

| Dimension               | Factors Considered                              |
|------------------ |------------------------------------------ |
| Reliability Score     | Task completion rate, uptime, failure recovery |
| Ethics Score          | Number and severity of ethics violations or audits |
| Community Endorsements | Peer-reviewed feedback and endorsements |
| Performance Metrics   | Response latency, efficiency, resource utilization |
| Historical Behavior   | Longitudinal trend of trust-affecting events |

## Reputation Calculation Model

| Stage                    | Description                                  |
|------------------- |-------------------------------------- |
| Event Collection         | Ingest logs, ethics audits, and performance metrics |
| Score Weighting          | Apply configurable weight per dimension |
| Time Decay Adjustment    | Older events have diminishing influence over time |
| Ethics Amplification     | Ethics-related events weighted more heavily |
| Anomaly Detection Filter | Prevent manipulation by outlier behaviors |
| Final Reputation Scoring | Generate composite reputation score (0-100 scale) |

## Reputation Ledger Storage

| Storage Layer          | Purpose                                      |
|------------------ |------------------------------------ |
| Local Node Cache    | Fast-access score for real-time decisions |
| Distributed Reputation Ledger | Decentralized, append-only reputation history |
| Blockchain Backup (Optional) | Immutable storage for audit and public transparency |

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                   | Purpose                          |
|------ |----------------------- |---------------------------- |
| GET   | `/reputation/{entity_id}` | Retrieve current reputation score |
| POST  | `/reputation/event`      | Submit new reputation-impacting event |
| GET   | `/reputation/history/{entity_id}` | View historical reputation changes |
| POST  | `/reputation/endorsement` | Submit peer endorsement or vote |

## Use Cases

| Scenario                   | Reputation Functionality                    |
|-------------------- |------------------------------------ |
| Task Scheduling Prioritization | Prefer high-reputation agents for critical tasks |
| Skill Deployment Restrictions | Block skill execution by low-trust nodes |
| Marketplace Access | Restrict high-value data sales to trusted buyers |
| Federated Node Voting | Weight governance votes by Node reputation |
| Ethics Escalation | Auto-quarantine low-reputation entities |

---

## Extensibility

- AI-driven anomaly detection for reputation manipulation attempts
- Cross-Node-Class reputation normalization models
- User-visible trust badges for transparency
- Tokidao token integration for reputation-based rewards
