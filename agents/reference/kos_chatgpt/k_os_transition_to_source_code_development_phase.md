# kOS Transition to Source Code Development Phase

## Overview
With the completion of multi-phase architectural documentation, deployment planning, and detailed sprint backlog generation for key modules (TOSE, OEC, GEIG), the **kOS Project** now formally transitions into **Source Code Development Phase**.

This document serves as the official marker and guideline for this phase change.

---

## Completed Pre-Development Milestones

- ✅ Full 18-phase kOS ecosystem documentation set
- ✅ Node Class Specifications (10 active node types)
- ✅ Agent Class Manifest (13 defined, 10 active)
- ✅ Ethical Governance Framework (GEIG) design and validation flows
- ✅ Deployment and Federation Expansion Roadmap
- ✅ Contributor Onboarding Guidelines
- ✅ CI/CD Baseline Plan
- ✅ Module-Specific Sprint Backlogs for TOSE, OEC, and GEIG (Sprints 1–4)

---

## Transition Scope

### Starting Activities:
- **Source code scaffolding for core modules**
- **Containerization and deployment pipeline setup**
- **Testnet deployment bootstrapping**
- **Module-level implementation (TOSE, OEC, GEIG first)**
- **Federation communication protocols (foundation level)**

### Stopping Activities (For Now):
- ✅ No new sprint backlog generation
- ✅ No additional sprint testing documentation
- ✅ No more backlog grooming until source scaffolding exists

---

## Immediate Next Steps for Development Teams

1. Initialize full kOS monorepo or multi-repo structure using the **Source Code Scaffolding and Repository Plan**
2. Begin writing baseline code for:
   - TOSE task queue and scheduler
   - OEC execution controller
   - GEIG ethical decision engine
3. Set up CI/CD jobs for build, linting, and unit test execution
4. Deploy first working Testnet with minimal operational flow
5. Conduct initial smoke tests on task orchestration and ethical validation path

---

## Documentation Freeze Policy (Temporary)

- All major documentation phases (Phases 1–18, Backlogs, CI, Deployment Roadmap) are now **frozen** pending actual source code outcomes.
- Future documentation updates will be driven by:
  - Actual source code commits
  - API designs emerging from coding
  - Architectural changes during implementation

---

## Governance and Ethical Safeguard Reminder

All contributors entering the coding phase must:
- Adhere to GEIG enforcement at all stages
- Conduct ethical risk self-checks before feature commits
- Document any deviations from original specifications for review

---

## Conclusion
The **kOS Project** now enters full **Source Code Development Mode**. The ecosystem shifts from design and planning into live system build-out, with all contributors focusing on tangible software delivery.

✅ Next: If needed, I’m ready to help generate **starter source code templates**, **build CI jobs**, or **assist with developer onboarding automation**.
