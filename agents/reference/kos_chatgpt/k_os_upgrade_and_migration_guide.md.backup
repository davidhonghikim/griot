# kOS Upgrade and Migration Guide

## Overview
The **kOS Upgrade and Migration Guide (UMG)** defines the procedures, versioning policies, and best practices for safely upgrading kOS system components, agents, modules, and data storage layers across distributed nodes. It also provides guidance for migrating from older versions to newer ones with minimal downtime and zero data loss.

## Core Upgrade Principles

| Principle                | Description                                  |
|-------------------- |-------------------------------------- |
| Zero Data Loss        | No user or system data should be lost during upgrades |
| Backward Compatibility | Existing modules and agents must remain functional post-upgrade |
| Minimal Downtime       | Support rolling updates and blue/green deployments where possible |
| Ethics Preservation    | Preserve all HIEROS and JUNZI ethical enforcement layers throughout the upgrade process |
| Node Class Awareness   | Respect Node Class-specific upgrade constraints |

---

## Supported Upgrade Types

| Upgrade Type         | Description                                |
|---------------- |------------------------------------- |
| Hot Patch Deployment | Live update of specific agents or modules without restarting nodes |
| Rolling Agent Upgrade | Sequentially upgrade agents across nodes with no downtime |
| Orchestrator Update  | Controlled upgrade of orchestration layer, preserving task queues |
| Node Class-Specific Upgrade | Upgrade only specific Node Classes (e.g., all Skald nodes) |
| Full System Upgrade | Major version bump requiring global coordination |

---

## Migration Planning Steps

1. **Version Compatibility Check:** Ensure target version is compatible with all running agents and modules
2. **Backup:** Snapshot databases, state stores, and agent checkpoints
3. **Pre-Deployment Ethics Test:** Run JUNZI compliance tests on new codebase
4. **Canary Deployment (Optional):** Deploy to a small test subset of nodes
5. **Monitoring:** Observe metrics, error rates, and ethics violation counts during initial rollout
6. **Full Rollout:** Proceed with cluster-wide deployment
7. **Post-Upgrade Validation:** Run full health, ethics, and integration tests
8. **Rollback Plan Readiness:** Ensure ability to roll back at any time during the process

## Versioning Policy

| Change Type           | Versioning Rule                            |
|------------------ |------------------------------------ |
| Bug Fixes / Hotfixes | Patch-level version increment (X.Y.Z → X.Y.(Z+1)) |
| New Features (Backward Compatible) | Minor version bump (X.Y.Z → X.(Y+1).0) |
| Breaking Changes      | Major version bump (X.Y.Z → (X+1).0.0) |
| Ethics Model Update   | Ethics profile version bump tracked separately |

---

## Upgrade Rollback Strategies

| Failure Scenario      | Recommended Action                        |
|---------------- |----------------------------------- |
| Ethics Violation Spikes | Roll back to last known ethically-safe version |
| Agent Crash Surge      | Revert affected agents or disable unstable modules |
| Data Migration Error   | Restore from pre-upgrade backups        |
| API Incompatibility    | Deploy backward compatibility patches   |
| Unanticipated Performance Degradation | Trigger emergency rollback procedure |

---

## Developer Pre-Upgrade Checklist

| Task                      | Required For...                          |
|--------------------- |-------------------------------------- |
| Unit and Integration Tests | All modified code                     |
| Ethics Regression Testing | All changes affecting decision flows |
| Backup Verification      | Ensure database and storage snapshot integrity |
| Compatibility Testing     | Validate modules and agents against new system API versions |
| Documentation Updates     | Version notes, migration guides, changelogs |

---

## Operator Deployment Commands (Example CLI)

| Command                   | Description                                 |
|-------------------- |------------------------------------- |
| `kos upgrade plan`       | Generate a preview of planned upgrade steps |
| `kos upgrade execute`    | Start upgrade process                      |
| `kos rollback last`      | Revert to previous system state           |
| `kos upgrade status`     | Monitor current upgrade progress          |
| `kos upgrade verify`     | Run post-upgrade validation suite        |

---

## Post-Upgrade Validation Metrics

| Metric                   | Purpose                                   |
|-------------------- |------------------------------------ |
| System Uptime           | Ensure all nodes and agents restarted successfully |
| Agent Error Rate        | Monitor for sudden error spikes         |
| Ethics Filter Status    | Confirm ethics filters are operational  |
| API Compatibility Rate  | Test endpoint success across modules    |
| User Impact Reports     | Collect user feedback on system stability |
