# kOS Knowledge Graph and Ontology Management Layer

## Overview
The **kOS Knowledge Graph and Ontology Management Layer (KGOML)** is the central semantic intelligence infrastructure for the kOS ecosystem. It provides structured, queryable, and dynamically evolving knowledge representation of all entities, relationships, classifications, and contextual meaning across the system.

KGOML enables agents to reason, infer, classify, and contextually understand data, tasks, nodes, users, and external systems.

## 1. Core Components

### 1.1 Knowledge Graph Engine
- Graph database backend (e.g., Neo4j, TigerGraph, or custom implementation)
- Stores nodes (entities), edges (relationships), and properties (metadata)
- Supports SPARQL, Cypher, or Gremlin query languages

### 1.2 Ontology Manager
- Defines class hierarchies, relationship types, and attribute constraints
- Supports importing existing ontologies (e.g., FOAF, Schema.org, custom domain models)
- Version-controlled ontology schema management

### 1.3 Reasoning Engine
- Supports inferencing based on semantic relationships
- Rule-based logic layer for domain-specific reasoning tasks
- Supports forward-chaining and backward-chaining inference modes

### 1.4 Contextual Query Processor
- Context-aware query optimization
- Supports natural language query translation (via Skald modules)
- Multi-hop relational query support

---

## 2. Data Sources and Synchronization

- Agent-generated metadata
- Node-level telemetry and relationships
- User interactions and preferences
- External linked data sources (optional)
- Real-time updates from Data Transformation and Contextualization Engine (DTCE)

## 3. API Endpoints

- `/kgoml/query`
- `/kgoml/entity/add`
- `/kgoml/relationship/add`
- `/kgoml/ontology/update`
- `/kgoml/ontology/schema`
- `/kgoml/inference/run`
- `/kgoml/search`

---

## 4. Supported Features

- Entity classification
- Relationship mapping
- Semantic similarity scoring
- Knowledge graph expansion from new data inputs
- Cross-ontology mapping and federation
- Concept drift detection for evolving data models

---

## 5. Ethical Oversight and GEIG Hooks

- All reasoning actions pass GEIG ethical checks
- Privacy filters applied to sensitive knowledge graph entries
- Access control at the entity, relationship, and attribute level

---

## 6. Visualization and Analytics

- Graph visualization tools integrated into the kOS dashboard
- Entity relationship diagrams
- Pathfinding and shortest-path analysis
- Knowledge graph evolution timelines

---

## 7. Advanced Reasoning Features

- Temporal reasoning (cause-effect chains over time)
- Spatial reasoning (location-based entity mapping)
- Probabilistic reasoning for uncertain or incomplete data
- Hybrid AI reasoning by linking with external LLMs or expert systems

---

## 8. Scalability and Performance

- Distributed graph partitioning support
- In-memory graph caching for high-frequency queries
- Parallelized query execution engine
- Incremental graph updates for real-time consistency

---

## Conclusion
The **kOS Knowledge Graph and Ontology Management Layer (KGOML)** enables deep semantic understanding, complex reasoning, and contextual awareness across all agents and nodes in the kOS ecosystem.
