# kOS HIEROS Ethical Alignment Protocol

## Overview
The **kOS HIEROS Ethical Alignment Protocol** defines the foundational ethical framework that governs all agent decisions, system behaviors, and user interactions across the kOS ecosystem. HIEROS stands for **Humanity-Informed Ethical Reasoning and Oversight System** and embeds ethical alignment into every layer of system design, deployment, and operation.

## Core Ethical Principles (The Seven Intentions)

| Principle                    | Description                                      |
|-------------------------- |---------------------------------------------- |
| Stewardship                 | Prioritize long-term well-being for users, communities, and ecosystems |
| Transparency                | Ensure system actions are understandable and reviewable |
| Consent                     | Always require user-informed, voluntary participation |
| Privacy and Sovereignty     | Protect user data ownership and privacy rights |
| Fairness and Non-Discrimination | Prevent bias, discrimination, or systemic exclusion |
| Accountability              | Enable traceability, responsibility, and redress for actions |
| Adaptability and Learning   | Continuously evolve ethical reasoning based on new insights |

## Ethical Enforcement Layers

| Layer                     | Function                                      |
|------------------------ |------------------------------------------- |
| Pre-Action Filter (JUNZI) | Block unethical actions before execution   |
| Real-Time Ethics Monitor | Monitor running agents for ethics compliance |
| Post-Action Auditor      | Review completed actions for violations    |
| Ethics Violation Logger  | Persist violation data for audit and review |
| User Redress API         | Allow users to appeal or report perceived ethical failures |

---

## Decision-Making Flow (HIEROS Pipeline)

1. **Input Evaluation:** Analyze incoming request, user input, or environmental trigger
2. **Ethical Risk Assessment:** Score action risk across the Seven Intentions dimensions
3. **Contextual Sensitivity Check:** Evaluate current user, system, and environmental state
4. **Policy Filter:** Apply hard ethical blocks if required
5. **Transparency Injection:** Attach ethics decision metadata to agent output
6. **Post-Action Logging:** Write decision trace to immutable audit log

## Ethical Risk Scoring Model

| Dimension                 | Example Risk Factors                      |
|---------------------- |------------------------------------- |
| User Harm Potential     | Physical, emotional, digital harm likelihood |
| Consent Violation Risk  | Level of informed consent present          |
| Privacy Breach Risk     | Exposure of user-identifiable or sensitive data |
| Bias and Discrimination | Evidence of systemic or unintended bias    |
| Autonomy Intrusion      | Level of user control bypass              |
| Environmental Harm      | Ecological impact for system-level actions |
| Accountability Gap      | Absence of traceability or redress mechanisms |

## Integration Points

| kOS Layer              | HIEROS Role                               |
|-------------------- |------------------------------------ |
| Agent Lifecycle      | Ethical alignment at spawn and shutdown |
| Skill Execution      | Ethical filtering before and during skill execution |
| Communication Bus    | Filter outbound and inbound messages for ethics violations |
| Deployment Pipelines | Ethics checks during build, test, and deploy phases |
| User Data Access      | Consent and privacy filters for all user data operations |

---

## Developer Responsibilities

| Requirement              | Mandatory For...                          |
|--------------------- |-------------------------------------- |
| Ethics Impact Assessment | All new modules, agents, or API endpoints |
| Ethical Unit Tests       | Any code paths that involve user data or external effects |
| Ethical Risk Documentation | Required for all system-critical modules |
| Decision Transparency   | Include ethics decision metadata in system logs and API responses |

---

## User Rights and Controls

| Right                      | Implementation                            |
|---------------------- |------------------------------------ |
| Data Access Logs          | User can view who accessed their data |
| Violation Reporting       | Submit ethics complaints via User Redress API |
| Profile Data Deletion     | Full deletion of stored user data on request |
| Opt-Out Controls          | Granular opt-outs for specific system features |

---

## Future Extensions

- Machine learning for ethics violation prediction
- Federated ethical learning across node clusters
- Real-time user feedback loops for in-situ ethics tuning
- External ethics board API integrations
