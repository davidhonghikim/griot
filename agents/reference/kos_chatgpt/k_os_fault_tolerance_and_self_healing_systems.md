# kOS Fault Tolerance and Self-Healing Systems

## Overview
The **kOS Fault Tolerance and Self-Healing Systems (FTSHS)** framework defines the resilience strategies, failure detection mechanisms, auto-recovery processes, and system-wide health management protocols that enable kOS to operate reliably even under adverse conditions, unexpected failures, or partial system degradation.

## Core Fault Tolerance Strategies

| Strategy                | Purpose                                         |
|-------------------- |------------------------------------------- |
| Redundancy            | Deploy multiple instances of critical agents or nodes |
| Failover Mechanisms   | Automatically switch to backup systems or nodes upon failure |
| Graceful Degradation  | Reduce functionality in controlled ways under high load or partial outages |
| Health Monitoring     | Continuously track agent and node status for proactive detection |
| Circuit Breaking      | Prevent cascading failures by isolating faulted components |

---

## Failure Detection Mechanisms

| Detection Type         | Trigger Event                                 |
|------------------ |----------------------------------------- |
| Heartbeat Monitoring   | Missing periodic health check-ins from agents or nodes |
| Resource Exhaustion    | High CPU, memory, or network saturation levels |
| Error Rate Spikes      | Sudden increase in agent or system error logs |
| Ethics Violation Escalation | Repeated or critical ethics filter failures |
| Unresponsive Agent/API | Non-responsive service endpoints            |

---

## Self-Healing Actions

| Recovery Action       | Trigger Condition                            |
|---------------- |----------------------------------------- |
| Agent Auto-Restart    | Uncaught exceptions or runtime errors       |
| Node Reallocation      | Node crash or hard failure                  |
| Service Downgrade      | Insufficient resources, switch to minimal service mode |
| Load Shedding          | Severe load spikes, drop non-essential tasks |
| Ethics-Triggered Quarantine | Persistent ethics violations                |

---

## Fault Domain Isolation

| Layer                 | Isolation Boundary                           |
|------------------ |----------------------------------------- |
| Agent Level         | Sandbox per agent instance                  |
| Node Level          | Physical or virtual node containment       |
| Network Level       | Segment traffic to prevent failure spread  |
| Data Storage Level  | Replicate and partition data across storage nodes |
| Ethics Layer        | Prevent ethics breach effects from propagating |

---

## Monitoring and Recovery Loop

1. **Health Check Cycle:** Regular status checks on agents, nodes, services
2. **Anomaly Detection:** Flag deviations from normal operation
3. **Failure Classification:** Categorize issue (Agent, Node, Network, Ethics, Resource)
4. **Recovery Trigger:** Launch predefined self-healing routine
5. **Escalation (If Needed):** Notify human operators or escalate to Junzi/Archon nodes
6. **Audit and Logging:** Record all failure events and recovery actions

## Developer Design Requirements

| Requirement                | Mandatory For...                          |
|--------------------- |-------------------------------------- |
| Idempotent Recovery Code | All agents capable of being restarted safely |
| Healthcheck Endpoint      | Each agent and microservice must expose a health status endpoint |
| Timeout and Retry Logic   | All network or inter-agent calls must include retry/backoff logic |
| Ethics Fallback Handling  | Define safe behavior on ethics filter failure |
| Failure Event Hooks       | Emit failure telemetry for monitoring systems |

---

## Metrics and Health Indicators

| Metric                     | Purpose                                  |
|---------------------- |------------------------------------ |
| Agent Crash Rate          | Monitor agent stability               |
| Node Uptime               | Track node reliability               |
| Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR) | Evaluate recovery speed             |
| Ethics Quarantine Count   | Track frequency of ethics-triggered quarantines |
| Resource Saturation Alerts | Monitor for system resource pressure |

## Extensibility

- AI-driven anomaly detection (future phase)
- Federated self-healing coordination across regions
- User-configurable failure response policies
- Ethics-aware failure classification for nuanced recovery paths

The **kOS Fault Tolerance and Self-Healing Systems (FTSHS)** framework ensures that the kOS ecosystem remains resilient, adaptive, and ethically sound in the face of technical faults, performance degradation, and unexpected system failures.
