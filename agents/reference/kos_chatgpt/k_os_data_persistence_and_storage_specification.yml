# kOS Data Persistence and Storage Specification

## Overview
The **kOS Data Persistence and Storage Specification** defines how agents, nodes, and system services store, retrieve, and manage data across the kOS ecosystem. This layer ensures that state, logs, user data, configuration settings, audit trails, and agent contexts are stored securely, durably, and in compliance with ethical and operational standards.

---

## Core Storage Types

| Storage Type        | Purpose                                              |
|------------------- |---------------------------------------------------- |
| Agent State Storage | Maintain runtime and checkpoint states for agents  |
| Audit Log Storage   | Store immutable ethics and action audit trails     |
| Skill Registry Storage | Host skill packages, metadata, and version history |
| User Data Storage   | Retain user preferences, profiles, and personal data |
| Metrics and Telemetry | Capture system and agent performance metrics       |
| Contextual Knowledge Base | Persist long-term contextual memory for agents |

---

## Supported Storage Backends

| Backend Type        | Use Cases                                           |
|------------------ |-------------------------------------------------- |
| Local File System   | Lightweight deployments, offline nodes           |
| SQLite / LiteDB     | Embedded storage for single-node setups          |
| PostgreSQL / MySQL  | Scalable relational storage for multi-node deployments |
| NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis) | Fast, unstructured, or key-value data needs      |
| Distributed Object Storage (IPFS, S3, MinIO) | Large binary artifacts, backups, distributed skill registry |
| Blockchain-based Ledger (Optional) | Immutable audit trails and trustless storage |

---

## Data Retention Policies

| Data Type          | Default Retention Period        |
|------------------ |------------------------------- |
| Agent Checkpoints | 30 days (configurable)          |
| Ethics Audit Logs | Minimum 1 year (configurable)  |
| User Data         | Retained until user deletion request or per privacy settings |
| Skill Packages    | All versions preserved unless manually purged |
| Metrics/Telemetry | 90 days for detailed logs, aggregated statistics kept longer |

---

## Access Control and Security

| Security Feature         | Description                                      |
|----------------------- |----------------------------------------------- |
| Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) | Restrict who/what can read/write each storage category |
| Encryption-at-Rest       | Use AES-256 or stronger encryption for sensitive data |
| Encryption-in-Transit    | TLS for all networked storage interactions     |
| Audit Logging of Access  | Record all data access operations for compliance |
| Ethical Data Usage Enforcement | JUNZI layer filters queries that violate user consent or ethical boundaries |

---

## Backup and Recovery

| Component              | Strategy                                |
|--------------------- |-------------------------------------- |
| Local Snapshots       | Periodic snapshots for rapid recovery |
| Remote Replication     | Sync critical data to remote nodes   |
| Versioned Backups      | Keep historical versions of key datasets |
| Disaster Recovery Plan | Full node recovery workflow          |

---

## Data Schema and Format Standards

| Data Type        | Format                         |
|--------------- |----------------------------- |
| Agent State     | JSON, Protobuf, or binary dumps |
| Audit Logs      | JSON Lines or append-only text  |
| Skill Metadata  | YAML or JSON                    |
| User Profiles   | JSON                            |
| Metrics         | Time-series format (e.g., Prometheus-compatible) |
| Context Data    | Vector embeddings, key-value stores, or document DBs |

---

## Data Access APIs

| API Method            | Purpose                           |
|-------------------- |------------------------------- |
| `save_state(agent_id, state_blob)` | Persist agent state        |
| `load_state(agent_id)` | Retrieve last saved state     |
| `log_event(event_type, payload)` | Append to audit logs         |
| `get_user_profile(user_id)` | Retrieve user-specific settings |
| `store_skill_package(skill_id, package_blob)` | Upload new skill package |
| `query_metrics(query_params)` | Fetch system or agent metrics |

---

## Data Synchronization and Replication

- Optional multi-node data replication for fault tolerance
- Support for eventual consistency models on distributed systems
- Configurable replication intervals and quorum levels

---

## Future Extensions

- Native support for graph databases for agent relationships
- AI-assisted data compression and storage optimization
- Decentralized storage incentives (integration with Tokidao layer)

---

The **kOS Data Persistence and Storage Specification** guarantees data integrity, availability, security, and ethical compliance across all nodes and agents within the kOS ecosystem.
