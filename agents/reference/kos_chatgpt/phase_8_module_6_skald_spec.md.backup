# Phase 8 Module Specification – Module 6: SKALD (Semantic Knowledge and Linguistic Dispatcher)

## Module Name

**SKALD – Semantic Knowledge and Linguistic Dispatcher**

## Purpose

SKALD is the universal language, communication, and knowledge formatting engine of the kOS ecosystem. It handles multi-format content generation, translation, semantic enrichment, natural language processing, and context-aware narrative building for all entities—human or machine—inside the system.

SKALD ensures that any form of communication, whether it's user-facing text, inter-agent signaling, documentation, multimedia descriptions, or machine-readable protocol, is contextually coherent, semantically accurate, and format-adaptive.

## Functional Overview

### Primary Functions:

1. **Universal Communication Formatting**

   - Translates agent-generated outputs into any target format (text, JSON, XML, speech, image captions, etc.)

2. **Multimodal and Multilingual Translation**

   - Converts messages across human languages, data formats, media types, and protocol specifications

3. **Semantic Enrichment and Contextual Framing**

   - Adds context-aware semantic layers to raw data streams for downstream consumption

4. **Narrative Assembly and Storytelling**

   - Builds structured narratives from event streams, agent outputs, or task logs

5. **Entity-to-Entity Meaning Mapping**

   - Provides cross-agent semantic normalization for interoperability

6. **Custom Tone and Style Adaptation**

   - Adapts output tone (formal, casual, humorous, technical, etc.) based on audience or use-case flags

## Detailed Module Architecture

### Input Channels:

- Agent or Node message payloads
- User prompts or requests
- Data outputs from other modules (OMNI, FRACTAL, DERE, etc.)
- External API payloads for translation or narrative formatting

### Output Channels:

- Human-readable interfaces (UI, CLI, dashboards)
- Machine-to-machine communication layers
- Logging and documentation streams
- External API response layers

### Core Components:

| Component                        | Description                                                      |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Format Converter (FC)**        | Converts between data formats (JSON ↔ XML ↔ YAML ↔ Text, etc.)   |
| **Language Translator (LT)**     | Multilingual translation between human languages                 |
| **Semantic Contextualizer (SC)** | Adds contextual meaning layers to raw outputs                    |
| **Narrative Builder (NB)**       | Generates narrative sequences, reports, and summaries            |
| **Tone and Style Adapter (TSA)** | Modulates output tone, formality, humor, or technical depth      |
| **Entity Normalizer (EN)**       | Standardizes semantic meaning across heterogeneous agent outputs |

## Key Algorithms and Processes

1. **Multi-Layer Translation Pipeline (MLTP)**

   - Sequential multi-pass conversion across format, language, tone, and semantic frames

2. **Semantic Enrichment Graph (SEG)**

   - Context graph for meaning disambiguation and enrichment

3. **Audience-Adaptive Tone Modulation (AATM)**

   - AI model-based tone and style adjustment

4. **Cross-Entity Semantic Normalization (CESN)**

   - Resolves vocabulary, data field, and conceptual mismatches across agents

5. **Narrative Generation Logic (NGL)**

   - Builds coherent, structured, audience-targeted narratives from multi-agent logs

## API Endpoints (Internal to kOS)

| Endpoint           | Method | Description                                          |
| ------------------ | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `/skald/translate` | POST   | Translate payload across target languages or formats |
| `/skald/enrich`    | POST   | Add semantic context to data payload                 |
| `/skald/format`    | POST   | Reformat data between supported types                |
| `/skald/narrative` | POST   | Generate narrative or report from input events       |
| `/skald/tone`      | POST   | Adjust tone, style, or formality of output           |

## Dependencies

- **OMNI (Data Source for Event Streams)**
- **FRACTAL (For distributed content generation coordination)**
- **DERE (For entity message inputs)**
- **External NLP models / language packs**
- **Optional: External LLM backends (open source or third-party)**

---

## Deployment Considerations

- Requires high-availability NLP processing layers
- Should support pluggable LLM backends
- Needs caching layer for repeated translation tasks
- Hot-reloadable language models for new language support

---

## Testing and Validation Requirements

- Format conversion fidelity tests
- Multi-language translation accuracy benchmarks
- Semantic context mapping validation with edge cases
- Tone modulation QA with human reviewers
- Narrative consistency tests over multi-agent event logs

---

## Future Extensions

- Real-time speech synthesis integration
- Media-to-text and text-to-media generation (image captions, voice-over scripts)
- Contextual humor and emotion-aware narrative generation
