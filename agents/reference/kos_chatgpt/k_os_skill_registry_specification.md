# kOS Skill Registry Specification

## Overview
The **kOS Skill Registry** serves as the global, decentralized directory and distribution platform for all agent skills within the kOS ecosystem. It enables dynamic discovery, retrieval, validation, and version management of skill modules by any authorized agent.

## Core Functions

| Function             | Description                                                  |
|-------------------- |------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Skill Publishing     | Allows developers to submit and register new skill packages  |
| Skill Discovery      | Enables agents to query available skills based on role, type, compatibility, or tags |
| Version Management   | Maintains version history, rollback options, and changelogs   |
| Security Validation  | Runs static and dynamic checks for malicious or harmful code |
| Ethical Metadata Tagging | Each skill is tagged with JUNZI ethical compatibility levels |
| Dependency Resolution | Manages inter-skill and external library dependencies        |

## Skill Package Format

| Section              | Purpose                                         |
|-------------------- |----------------------------------------------- |
| Manifest             | YAML/JSON describing skill name, author, version, description |
| Runtime Code         | Python (default) or any supported execution format |
| Dependencies         | List of required external libraries and versions |
| Ethical Profile      | Embedded JUNZI ethical compliance declarations |
| Test Suite           | Optional unit and integration tests for the skill |
| Metadata             | Tags, categories, compatibility flags          |

---

## Registry Architecture

| Component           | Function                                       |
|------------------- |--------------------------------------------- |
| Central Skill Index | Global skill metadata index (searchable)     |
| Distributed Skill Nodes | Decentralized peer nodes hosting skill content |
| Hash Verification Layer | Ensures integrity of all downloaded skills |
| Access Control Layer | Role-based permissions for publishing or updating skills |
| API Gateway          | Allows programmatic search, pull, and push operations |

---

## API Endpoints (Example)

| Method | Endpoint                   | Description                |
|------ |--------------------------- |-------------------------- |
| GET   | `/skills`                   | List all available skills |
| GET   | `/skills/{skill_id}`        | Fetch skill metadata      |
| POST  | `/skills`                   | Publish a new skill       |
| GET   | `/skills/search?query=...`  | Query skills by tag/type  |
| GET   | `/skills/{skill_id}/download` | Download skill package    |

---

## Deployment Models

| Model              | Notes                                              |
|------------------ |-------------------------------------------------- |
| Fully Decentralized | Uses P2P skill sharing (preferred for offline/micro deployments) |
| Federated Hub-and-Spoke | Central core registry with local mirrors or cache nodes |
| Private Registry   | Enterprise or sensitive deployment environments |

---

## Ethical Integration

- Every skill must declare its **Ethical Impact Level** using the JUNZI classification.
- Skills flagged for sensitive operations require elevated deployment approval.
- Runtime ethical filters can dynamically block or allow skills based on current context.

---

## Versioning Policy

- **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**
- Example: `SkillName v2.3.1`
- Changelogs required for all major and minor updates.
- Deprecation notices must be included for breaking changes.

---

## Skill Trust and Verification Flow

1. **Hash Check:** SHA-256 checksum validation
2. **Signature Verification:** PGP or GPG signed packages
3. **Ethics Scan:** Pre-deployment JUNZI filter pass
4. **Sandbox Test:** Runtime behavior scan before activation

---

## Skill Lifecycle States

| State          | Description                            |
|------------- |-------------------------------------- |
| Draft          | Under development                    |
| Submitted      | Uploaded for review                  |
| Approved       | Passed all tests and ethics checks   |
| Deprecated     | Marked for phase-out                |
| Revoked        | Blacklisted for ethics or security reasons |

---

## Future Extensions

- Community rating and feedback for skills
- AI-assisted skill recommendation system
- Inter-skill dependency graph visualization

---

This specification governs how all skills in the kOS ecosystem are developed, distributed, and managed. All future agent skill development must comply with this standard.
