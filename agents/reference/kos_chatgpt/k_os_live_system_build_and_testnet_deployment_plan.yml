# kOS Live System Build and Testnet Deployment Plan

## Overview
The **kOS Live System Build and Testnet Deployment Plan** details the step-by-step process for assembling the first full working instance of the kOS ecosystem and deploying it in a controlled testnet environment. This phase transitions the project from documentation and design into live, operational infrastructure.

The plan covers build orchestration, testnet configuration, early node participant setup, and initial validation steps.

---

## 1. Build Orchestration Strategy

### 1.1 Build Automation Tools
- Docker Compose for single-node build testing
- Kubernetes Helm Charts for multi-node orchestration
- Ansible playbooks for bare-metal deployments
- CI/CD pipeline triggers for automated build validation

### 1.2 Target Build Artifacts
- Container images for each node class
- Agent binary or package bundles per agent class
- Configuration files for GEIG, TOSE, and OEC
- Initial Knowledge Graph and Policy Snapshots

---

## 2. Testnet Deployment Topology

### 2.1 Initial Cluster Size
- 5-node testnet
  - 1 Governance Node
  - 1 Ethics Node
  - 1 Control Node
  - 1 Memory Node
  - 1 Multi-purpose Node (Processing + Skald + Discovery)

### 2.2 Network Configuration
- Private VPC or VPN-backed network layer
- Optional public API gateway for external test participants
- Encrypted inter-node communication (TLS/mTLS)

### 2.3 Federation Simulation
- Simulated external clusters for cross-cluster task routing tests
- Placeholder nodes for future external partners

---

## 3. Early Node Participant Program

- Invite internal developers and designated external partners
- Provide container images or deployment scripts
- Issue GEIG ethical compliance agreement for all participants
- Establish onboarding support channel for testnet nodes

---

## 4. Pre-Deployment Checklist

- CI/CD build success confirmation
- GEIG policy validation pass
- Container image integrity checks
- Test telemetry endpoints and dashboards
- Validate rollback plan for failed deployment

---

## 5. Deployment Steps

1. Launch infrastructure (cloud, bare-metal, or hybrid)
2. Deploy core infrastructure services (TOSE, OEC, GEIG)
3. Bring up each Node Class sequentially
4. Register agents with Control Nodes
5. Enable inter-node messaging via the Communication Bus
6. Run health checks across nodes and agents
7. Trigger sample workflows for system validation

---

## 6. Post-Deployment Validation

- Run functional tests across all active node classes
- Validate ethical gating for task executions
- Test telemetry stream integrity
- Verify data storage and recall from Memory Nodes
- Confirm end-to-end Skald message lifecycle

---

## 7. Risk Management for Testnet

- Isolation from production data and networks
- Rate limiting for experimental agents
- Daily snapshot backups
- Monitoring for misbehaving nodes or agents
- Dedicated recovery playbooks

---

## 8. Next Steps After Testnet Success

- Expand cluster size for stress testing
- Invite broader external contributor participation
- Initiate performance benchmarking
- Schedule Phase 17 – Production Readiness Hardening

---

## Conclusion
The **kOS Live System Build and Testnet Deployment Plan** provides a structured, controlled, and ethically governed pathway for transitioning the kOS ecosystem into its first operational environment—laying the foundation for full production rollout.

✅ This completes Phase 16 deliverables.

Next: Proceeding to **Phase 17 – Production Readiness Hardening** planning documentation.
