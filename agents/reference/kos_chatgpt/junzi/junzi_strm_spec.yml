# JUNZI Phase 7 - Detailed Technical Specification: Stakeholder Trust Resilience Module (STRM)

## Module Name:

Stakeholder Trust Resilience Module (STRM)

## Module Purpose:

The STRM continuously monitors, analyzes, and recalibrates stakeholder trust dynamics within JUNZI. It models trust sentiment trends, triggers proactive trust recovery workflows after ethical incidents, and ensures ongoing alignment between system behavior and stakeholder expectations.

---

## System Architecture

### Trust Resilience Pipeline:

1. **Trust Sentiment Aggregator:**

   - Ingests real-time feedback and sentiment signals from:
     - SFL (direct stakeholder feedback)
     - JEDE (decision satisfaction scores)
     - EOMH (ethical KPI outputs)
     - ERFE (risk perception deltas)

2. **Trust Index Computation Engine:**

   - Calculates:
     - Stakeholder Trust Index (STI)
     - Sentiment Volatility Rate
     - Trust Recovery Speed Post-Incident

3. **Anomaly Detection Layer:**

   - Flags significant trust dips linked to:
     - Rule changes
     - High-impact decisions
     - Ethical conflict clusters

4. **Proactive Trust Recovery Orchestrator:**

   - Coordinates:
     - Stakeholder outreach campaigns via SFL
     - Transparency report releases
     - Optional stakeholder Q&A sessions

5. **Trust Forecasting Module:**

   - Predicts short-term trust trajectory based on:
     - Historical trust data
     - Current sentiment patterns
     - Risk event correlations

6. **Stakeholder Feedback Loop Integrator:**

   - Feeds trust trend insights back into AREE and JEDE for ethical reasoning recalibration.

## Data Models

### Stakeholder Trust Snapshot:

```json

  "snapshot_id": "uuid",
  "stakeholder_group": "string",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601",
  "trust_index": "float",
  "sentiment_volatility": "float",
  "recent_incident_impact": "float",
  "recovery_rate": "float"
}
```

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint                                 | Method | Description                                               |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| /strm/get-trust-index                    | GET    | Returns current global and group-level trust scores       |
| /strm/get-trust-trend                    | POST   | Returns historical trust trend data                       |
| /strm/trigger-recovery-action            | POST   | Initiates targeted stakeholder trust recovery workflow    |
| /strm/get-incident-impact/{incident\_id} | GET    | Retrieves trust impact analysis for a specific incident   |
| /strm/get-forecast/{group\_id}           | GET    | Provides short-term trust trajectory forecast for a group |

---

## Algorithms and Logic

1. **Weighted Trust Scoring Algorithm:**

   - Combines sentiment, engagement, and decision satisfaction inputs.

2. **Anomaly Detection Algorithm:**

   - Uses time series outlier detection for rapid trust drop identification.

3. **Trust Recovery Recommendation Engine:**

   - Matches trust dips with predefined recovery playbooks.

---

## Performance Targets

- **Trust Index Update Frequency:** Every 10 minutes
- **Anomaly Detection Time:** Under 5 minutes
- **Trust Recovery Workflow Trigger Latency:** Under 2 minutes post-detection

---

## Monitoring and Metrics

- **Trust Volatility Rate**
- **Recovery Success Rate**
- **Sentiment Change Frequency**
- **Incident-to-Recovery Time**

Monitoring Tools: Prometheus + Grafana; Trust health and sentiment dashboards.

---

## Security Considerations

- Anonymization of stakeholder feedback before analysis
- RBAC for recovery workflow triggers
- Audit logging for all trust recalibration events (stored in EAT)
- TLS encryption for all API traffic

---

## Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests:**

  - Trust score calculation functions
  - Anomaly detection accuracy

- **Integration Tests:**

  - STRM â†” SFL, JEDE, EOMH, ERFE, AREE data pipelines

- **Load Tests:**

  - High-frequency sentiment input simulation

- **Recovery Workflow Validation Tests:**

  - Efficacy of trust rebuilding actions

---

## Deployment Profile

- **Language:** Python 3.11
- **Containerization:** Docker + Kubernetes
- **Storage:** PostgreSQL for trust snapshots; S3 for recovery workflow logs

---

## Dependencies

- SFL API
- JEDE API
- EOMH API
- ERFE API
- AREE API
- EAT API
