# JUNZI Phase 5 - Detailed Technical Specification: Advanced Policy and Action Simulator v2 (PASv2)

## Module Name:

Advanced Policy and Action Simulator v2 (PASv2)

## Module Purpose:

PASv2 provides a next-generation simulation environment for stress-testing ethical decision policies, stakeholder models, and system rules against highly complex, multi-agent, multi-context, and time-evolving scenarios. It integrates historical data, predictive modeling, and emergent behavior simulation to preemptively detect ethical risks and system failure points.

## System Architecture

### Simulation Execution Pipeline:

1. **Scenario Generator v2:**

   - Supports:
     - Multi-agent simulation entities (Stakeholders, AI agents, external systems)
     - Time-evolving decision trees
     - Stochastic scenario branches
   - Can auto-generate scenarios using EPR and EKB pattern feeds.

2. **Contextual Timeline Engine:**

   - Allows simulation over hours, days, or weeks of simulated time.
   - Models context evolution (e.g., stakeholder mood shifts, policy changes, environmental variables).

3. **Agent Behavior Models:**

   - Supports:
     - Probabilistic stakeholder behavior modeling
     - Adversarial agent insertion for stress testing
     - Drift-prone decision path simulation

4. **Ethical Consequence Forecaster:**

   - Predicts downstream ethical impacts for simulated decisions.
   - Uses reinforcement learning and causal inference models.

5. **Multi-Metric Outcome Evaluator:**

   - Tracks:
     - Ethical conflict accumulation
     - Risk exposure over time
     - Stakeholder trust evolution
     - Consent churn rates

6. **Simulation Control API Layer:**

   - Allows pause, resume, speed adjust, and rewind of simulations.

7. **Reporting and Export Engine:**

   - Generates detailed simulation outcome reports with recommended policy adjustments.
