# JUNZI Phase 4 - Detailed Technical Specification: Stakeholder Voting Network (SVN)

## Module Name:

Stakeholder Voting Network (SVN)

## Module Purpose:

The SVN provides a decentralized, transparent, and auditable mechanism for global stakeholders to vote on proposed ethical rule changes, system policy adjustments, and governance decisions within JUNZI. It ensures democratic participation, fairness, and traceability in all stakeholder-driven decisions.

---

## System Architecture

### Voting Process Pipeline:

1. **Proposal Submission Layer:**

   - Accepts new rule change proposals from:
     - Ethics Governance Council
     - SFL-generated feedback aggregations
     - External stakeholder petition systems

2. **Stakeholder Eligibility Validator:**

   - Verifies eligible voters based on:
     - Stakeholder registry (managed in Phase 1)
     - Geographic region
     - Stakeholder role and classification

3. **Voting Session Manager:**

   - Creates, configures, and schedules voting sessions:
     - Defines voting window (start and end times)
     - Configures voting method (simple majority, supermajority, weighted vote)
     - Publishes official proposal summary and impact assessment

4. **Ballot Distribution and Collection Layer:**

   - Sends secure voting links or API tokens to eligible stakeholders.
   - Collects, encrypts, and stores incoming votes.

5. **Vote Tally Engine:**

   - Aggregates votes based on session rules.
   - Supports weighted voting models based on stakeholder impact tiers.

6. **Result Certification Layer:**

   - Validates vote integrity.
   - Applies cryptographic signatures to finalized results.
   - Stores final tallies in EAT for full auditability.

7. **Rule Update Trigger:**

   - Sends certified results to DERE for rule version updates if the proposal passes.

## Data Models

### Voting Proposal Record:

```json
{
  "proposal_id": "uuid",
  "title": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "initiator": "user_id | system_module",
  "voting_method": "SimpleMajority | SuperMajority | Weighted",
  "eligible_stakeholders": ["stakeholder_id"],
  "start_time": "ISO8601",
  "end_time": "ISO8601",
  "status": "Pending | Active | Closed | Certified",
  "result": "Pending | Approved | Rejected | Contested"
}
```

### Vote Submission Record:

```json
{
  "vote_id": "uuid",
  "proposal_id": "uuid",
  "voter_id": "uuid",
  "vote": "Yes | No | Abstain",
  "weight": "float",
  "submitted_at": "ISO8601"
}
```

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint                                 | Method | Description                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| /svn/create-proposal                     | POST   | Submits a new voting proposal                                       |
| /svn/start-voting-session/{proposal\_id} | POST   | Initiates voting session                                            |
| /svn/submit-vote                         | POST   | Submits a stakeholder’s vote                                        |
| /svn/get-results/{proposal\_id}          | GET    | Returns current or final vote tallies                               |
| /svn/certify-results/{proposal\_id}      | POST   | Certifies final voting outcome and triggers rule update if approved |

## Algorithms and Logic

1. **Stakeholder Weighting Logic:**

   - Calculates individual vote weight based on predefined stakeholder impact levels.

2. **Vote Tally Logic:**

   - Applies selected voting method (simple, supermajority, or weighted) to compute results.

3. **Cryptographic Vote Certification:**

   - Uses SHA256 or SHA3 hashing + digital signatures for result integrity.

---

## Performance Targets

- **Vote Submission Latency:** Under 200ms per vote
- **Tally Processing Time:** Under 1 minute for up to 1M votes
- **Result Certification Latency:** Under 2 minutes

---

## Monitoring and Metrics

- **Voting Participation Rate**
- **Vote Integrity Error Rate**
- **Result Certification Time**
- **Proposal Success Rate by Category**

Monitoring Tools: Prometheus + Grafana; Voting KPI dashboards.

---

## Security Considerations

- OAuth 2.0 + Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for voter identity
- End-to-end vote encryption
- Anti-tampering safeguards for vote storage
- Full audit trail for every voting event (via EAT)

---

## Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests:**

  - Vote validation logic
  - Tally computation correctness

- **Integration Tests:**

  - SVN ↔ DERE rule update flow
  - SVN ↔ EAT audit logging

- **Load Tests:**

  - High-volume voting session simulation

- **Security Tests:**

  - Vote tampering resistance
  - Authentication bypass attempts

---

## Deployment Profile

- **Language:** Python 3.11 or Node.js 18+
- **Containerization:** Docker + Kubernetes
- **Storage:** PostgreSQL for voting records; optional IPFS or distributed ledger for external vote proofs

---

## Dependencies

- DERE API
- EAT API
- SFL API (for proposal initiations)
- User Identity Service (for stakeholder verification)
