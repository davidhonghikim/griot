# JUNZI Agent Capability Descriptions

**Node Class:** JunziNode  
**System:** kOS Ecosystem

This document details each individual JUNZI Agent and its precise operational role inside the JunziNode deployment.

---

## Agent Roster:

### 1. **ContradictionScannerAgent**
- **Role:** Real-time NLP-driven detection of contradictions between public statements and observable actions by tracked entities.
- **Key Functions:**
  - Time-sequenced statement comparison
  - Semantic contradiction detection
  - Confidence scoring for contradictions
  - Source linkback for every data point
- **Outputs:** Structured contradiction reports → GriotNode, YachayNode, OracleNode

---

### 2. **RiskProfilerAgent**
- **Role:** Calculates entity risk scores for ethical integrity violations.
- **Key Functions:**
  - Multivariate risk modeling
  - Weighting by jurisdiction, historical behavior, financial patterns
  - Bias audit log attached to every score
- **Outputs:** Entity risk profiles → Public API, OracleNode, YachayNode

---

### 3. **JurisdictionContextAgent**
- **Role:** Classifies every action, contradiction, and risk by jurisdictional scope (local, state, federal, international, etc).
- **Key Functions:**
  - Jurisdictional tagging
  - Contextual boundary classification
  - Metadata injection for downstream agents
- **Outputs:** Jurisdictional annotations → GriotNode, OracleNode

---

### 4. **BiasAuditAgent**
- **Role:** Runs counter-bias checks across all AI/ML outputs to enforce nonpartisanship and mitigate systemic bias.
- **Key Functions:**
  - Multi-model consensus testing
  - Bias weight scoring
  - Flagging and mitigation of outlier or politically skewed results
- **Outputs:** Bias audit logs attached to risk profiles, contradiction reports, and all public-facing outputs

---

### 5. **PromiseTrackerAgent**
- **Role:** Tracks public promises made by entities and measures fulfillment vs outcome.
- **Key Functions:**
  - NLP-based promise detection during campaign speeches, press releases, or public statements
  - Lifecycle monitoring of promise statuses
  - Status flagging: Fulfilled / Broken / Pending / Stale
- **Outputs:** Promise records → Public API, GriotNode, YachayNode

---

### 6. **SourceAttributionAgent**
- **Role:** Guarantees that all data inputs and outputs have full source lineage and tamper-proof audit trails.
- **Key Functions:**
  - Data provenance tagging
  - Immutable hash generation for every input
  - External source cross-validation
- **Outputs:** Provenance metadata attached to all entity profiles, risk scores, contradiction reports

---

### 7. **PublicExposureAgent**
- **Role:** Controls the final public output flow of JUNZI-generated alerts, reports, and data streams.
- **Key Functions:**
  - Publishing contradiction alerts
  - Broadcasting risk threshold crossings
  - Exposing promise fulfillment statuses
  - Managing API rate limits and user-facing endpoints
- **Outputs:** Live API feeds → Public dashboards, CommunicatorNode (for broadcast)

---

**This document now serves as the canonical capability map for all JUNZI Agents within the kOS ecosystem until formally revised.**
