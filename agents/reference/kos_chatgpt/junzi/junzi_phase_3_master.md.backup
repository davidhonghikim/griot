# JUNZI Phase 3: External Pilot Program Deployment and Iterative Calibration (Master Document)

## Overview
Phase 3 marks JUNZIâ€™s first exposure to real-world, external environments beyond controlled lab and development settings. This phase focuses on executing structured external pilot programs with carefully selected stakeholder groups, collecting live feedback, monitoring system behavior, and iteratively calibrating the ethical, technical, and governance layers before broader rollout.

## Master Goals for Phase 3

1. **Pilot Deployment Readiness:**
   - Deploy stable JUNZI instances across multiple external stakeholder environments (corporate, civic, research, NGO, etc.)
   - Ensure all Phase 2 modules are production-hardened and externally accessible

2. **Ethical Feedback Loop Activation:**
   - Operationalize Stakeholder Feedback Loop (SFL) under real-world load
   - Prioritize stakeholder-driven rule modification and consent feedback cycles

3. **Scenario Diversity Testing:**
   - Run diverse ethical scenarios reflecting different cultural, legal, and operational contexts
   - Stress-test JEDE under unpredictable, high-variance decision loads

4. **Ethical Drift and Rule Adaptation Monitoring:**
   - Deploy real-time Ethical Drift Monitors (EDM)
   - Detect ethical inconsistencies across pilot sites
   - Trigger rule recalibration workflows as needed

5. **Multi-Instance Data Synchronization:**
   - Ensure decision logs (EAT), rule updates (DERE), and stakeholder inputs (SFL) sync reliably across all pilot nodes

6. **Performance Benchmarking:**
   - Establish key performance metrics for ethical decision latency, stakeholder satisfaction, rule conflict frequency, and risk detection rates

## Detailed Deliverables for Phase 3

1. **Pilot Deployment Plan:**
   - Stakeholder site selection criteria
   - Deployment schedules and environment configurations

2. **External Ethics Monitoring Dashboard:**
   - Unified cross-pilot site dashboard for ethical performance, stakeholder feedback volume, and risk flags

3. **Ethical Drift Monitor (EDM) Module:**
   - Algorithmic detection of ethical rule drift
   - Visualizations of rule divergence across sites

4. **Pilot Site-Specific JEDE Calibration Profiles:**
   - Per-site context weighting adjustments
   - Localization of stakeholder impact models

5. **Ethical Incident Response Protocol:**
   - Steps for rapid ethical failure remediation
   - Human review and rollback procedures

6. **Pilot Feedback Analysis Report Templates:**
   - Standardized formats for summarizing pilot outcomes

7. **Ethical Performance Benchmarking Report:**
   - Baseline metrics for decision accuracy, ethical conflict rates, and stakeholder trust index

8. **Iterative Rule Refinement Logs:**
   - Version-controlled history of all rule changes during pilot

## Governance and Oversight Structures for Phase 3

| Body | Function |
|----|----|
| External Ethics Review Board (EERB-X) | Independent oversight of pilot ethical impacts |
| Stakeholder Liaison Coordinators | Direct communication between JUNZI team and pilot sites |
| Pilot Risk Response Team | Rapid intervention for critical ethical failures |
| Ethics Data Science Team | Monitor, analyze, and model ethical drift and decision anomalies |

---

## Metrics for Phase 3 Success

| Metric | Target |
|----|----|
| Pilot Deployment Completion Rate | 100% of selected sites operational |
| Stakeholder Satisfaction Index | >85% positive trust rating |
| Ethical Drift Detection Accuracy | >90% |
| Ethical Incident Resolution Time | < 2 hours for critical events |
| Decision Latency | < 100ms for 95% of standard cases |

---

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies

| Risk | Mitigation |
|----|----|
| Ethical rule drift across sites | Deploy EDM and enforce daily ethical consistency checks |
| Stakeholder dissatisfaction | Activate continuous feedback monitoring and rapid response |
| External system integration failures | Pre-pilot technical validation sprints |
| Regulatory non-compliance | Conduct site-specific legal reviews before deployment |

---

## Next Steps
1. Finalize Pilot Site Partner Agreements
2. Deploy and configure JUNZI Phase 2 modules for external pilot use
3. Conduct baseline ethical calibration tests per site
4. Launch Stakeholder Feedback and Ethical Drift Monitoring systems
5. Prepare Phase 3 submodule specifications: EDM, External Monitoring Dashboard, Incident Response Protocols, and Calibration Tools
