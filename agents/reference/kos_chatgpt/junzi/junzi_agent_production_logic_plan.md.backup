# JUNZI Agent Production Logic Plan

**Node Class:** JunziNode  
**System:** kOS Ecosystem  
**Document Type:** Agent Implementation Strategy

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose:
To outline production-grade implementation details for each core JUNZI agent, ensuring scalable, testable, and ethical AI operations aligned with HIEROS and nonpartisan mandates.

---

## âœ… Agent Logic Development Standards:
| Standard | Details |
|---|---|
| Programming Language | Python 3.11+ |
| Deployment | Docker container per agent |
| Database Access | SQLAlchemy ORM with PostgreSQL |
| Logging | JSON structured logs with source attribution |
| Error Handling | Centralized error capture with retry mechanisms |
| Model Serving (if ML used) | OnnxRuntime / Hugging Face Transformers for NLP agents |
| Bias Safeguards | Every agent output passes through BiasAuditAgent before exposure |

---

## âœ… Agent-Level Implementation Plans:

### 1. ContradictionScannerAgent
| Logic Layer | Details |
|---|---|
| NLP Model | BERT-based or RoBERTa fine-tuned for contradiction detection |
| Input | Entity statements, actions, and timeline data |
| Output | ContradictionRecord inserts with confidence scores |
| Validation | Human-in-the-loop option for edge cases |

---

### 2. RiskProfilerAgent
| Logic Layer | Details |
|---|---|
| Scoring Factors | Contradiction frequency, severity, recency, promise fulfillment rate, dispute volume |
| Algorithm | Weighted scoring + ML-based risk classifier (optional for Phase 2) |
| Output | RiskScore table updates |

---

### 3. PromiseTrackerAgent
| Logic Layer | Details |
|---|---|
| Input | Public statements labeled as promises |
| Monitoring | Scheduled evaluation of actions tied to promises |
| Output | PromiseRecord status updates (Pending / Fulfilled / Broken / Stale) |

---

### 4. BiasAuditAgent
| Logic Layer | Details |
|---|---|
| Scope | Analyze outputs from ContradictionScanner, RiskProfiler, and PromiseTracker |
| Method | Bias scoring against demographic, political, geographic, and source bias dimensions |
| Output | BiasAuditLog entries with pass/fail flags |

---

### 5. SourceAttributionAgent
| Logic Layer | Details |
|---|---|
| Function | Validate all source IDs for ingested data points |
| Process | SHA-256 hash checking, source metadata verification |
| Output | Pass/fail flags on source legitimacy |

---

### 6. PublicExposureAgent
| Logic Layer | Details |
|---|---|
| Trigger | New contradictions, risk score changes, major alerts |
| Channel Output | Webhooks, Email alerts, Frontend API updates |
| Safety Layer | No public push happens until BiasAuditAgent final approval |

**This document now serves as the canonical Agent Production Logic Plan for JUNZI engineering teams within the kOS ecosystem until formally revised.**
