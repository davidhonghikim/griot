## 1. Ethical Decision Engine (JEDE) - Full Specification

### Purpose:
Real-time ethical decision-making at execution layer.

### Core Components:
- **Rule Evaluation Core:** Prioritizes ethical rules from DERE.
- **Context Weighing Module:** Adjusts decisions based on CAM inputs.
- **Conflict Resolution Subsystem:** Applies rule-based or heuristic approaches for dilemmas.
- **Audit Hook Layer:** Pushes all decision outputs with metadata to EAT.

### API Contract:
- **Input:** Context JSON + Proposed Action + Stakeholder Profile
- **Output:** Decision Result + Confidence Score + Ethical Justification

### Performance Requirements:
- Sub-100ms decision time for real-time environments.

## 2. Dynamic Ethical Rule Engine (DERE) - Module Blueprint

### Purpose:
Manage rule lifecycle from creation to retirement.

### Functional Layers:
- **Rule Authoring API:** REST endpoints for rule creation.
- **Validation Sandbox:** Runs proposed rules against historical data for regression testing.
- **Versioning Layer:** Full rule history with rollback capability.
- **Deployment Controller:** Gates rule publishing based on stakeholder and Ethics Council approval.

### Rule Format:
- JSON or YAML with embedded logical operators.

---

## 3. Values Translation Layer (VTL) - Conversion Pipeline

### Purpose:
Convert human-readable ethical policies into machine-executable rules.

### Pipeline Stages:
1. **Policy Parser:** NLP-driven extraction of key ethical intent.
2. **Contextual Mapper:** Links parsed inputs to ethical ontology categories.
3. **Rule Generator:** Outputs DERE-compatible rules.
4. **Simulated Run Checker:** Tests rule impact on JEDE sandbox.

### Supported Input Formats:
- PDF, DOCX, JSON policy documents.

---

## 4. Consent and Transparency Interface (CTI) - UX/UI and API Details

### Purpose:
Capture consent and explain ethical decisions.

### UI Features:
- **Decision Explanation Flow:** Stepwise reasoning visualizer.
- **Consent Request Triggers:** Configurable points for explicit user consent.
- **Feedback Portal:** UI for user input on decisions.

### API Endpoints:
- GET /decision-explanation
- POST /user-consent
- POST /user-feedback

### Compliance:
- GDPR and CCPA ready.
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility.

---

## 5. Ethical Audit Trail (EAT) - Data Schema and Storage Protocol

### Purpose:
Immutable decision record storage.

### Schema:
- **decision_id (UUID)**
- **timestamp (ISO8601)**
- **context_snapshot (JSON)**
- **rule_set_version (string)**
- **decision_result (JSON)**
- **consent_state (boolean)**
- **justification_summary (text)**

### Optional Storage:
- Blockchain integration layer (Hyperledger Fabric recommended).

---

## 6. Stakeholder Feedback Loop (SFL) - Processing Pipeline

### Purpose:
Turn stakeholder feedback into system updates.

### Workflow:
1. **Ingestion Layer:** Multi-channel input (web, API, email, surveys).
2. **Categorization Engine:** NLP-based topic and sentiment classification.
3. **Priority Scoring:** Weighs feedback based on urgency and stakeholder weight.
4. **Impact Mapper:** Links feedback to potentially affected rules in DERE.

### Outputs:
- Rule update proposals
- Stakeholder sentiment dashboards

---

## 7. Contextual Awareness Module (CAM) - Data Fusion Engine

### Purpose:
Aggregate contextual data streams.

### Input Sources:
- IoT sensors
- User behavior logs
- External API feeds

### Components:
- **Data Normalizer:** Standardizes inputs
- **Contextual Weight Assigner:** Scores data relevance
- **Anomaly Detector:** Flags context shifts

### Output Format:
- JSON Context Bundle with timestamps and relevance scores.

---

## 8. Policy and Action Simulator (PAS) - Scenario Modeling Framework

### Purpose:
Simulate decision impacts before live deployment.

### Features:
- **Scenario Builder GUI:** Allows creation of hypothetical inputs.
- **Ethical Stress Tester:** Runs thousands of edge-case scenarios automatically.
- **Simulation Report Generator:** Outputs ethical compliance metrics and conflict logs.

### Technical Stack:
- Python-based simulation engine
- SQLite/NoSQL for simulation logs

---

## 9. Risk Assessment and Mitigation Engine (RAME) - Risk Analytics Platform

### Purpose:
Detect and mitigate pre-action ethical risks.

### Modules:
- **Risk Scorer:** Bayesian and ML-based risk estimation.
- **Mitigation Recommender:** Rule-based suggestion engine for risk reduction.
- **Outcome Tracker:** Links pre-action risk scores with post-action outcomes for future model training.

### API Endpoints:
- POST /risk-assessment
- GET /risk-mitigation-suggestions

---

## 10. Integration and Deployment Infrastructure - CI/CD and API Gateway

### Features:
- **Central API Gateway:** Manages inter-module communication.
- **Service Discovery:** Dynamic module lookup.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Dockerized deployments with rollback support.
- **Environment Configuration:** Staging, testing, and production profiles.

## Testing, Validation, and QA Protocols

| Test Type | Scope |
|----|----|
| Unit Testing | Individual module functions |
| Integration Testing | Inter-module data flows |
| Ethical Scenario Testing | Simulation of edge-case ethical dilemmas |
| Load Testing | JEDE decision throughput under stress |
| User Acceptance Testing (UAT) | CTI usability and stakeholder satisfaction |

---

## Final Notes
All Phase 2 module specifications are designed to ensure ethical consistency, technical reliability, and stakeholder trust. These specs serve as the authoritative blueprint for development teams, QA engineers, and future Phase 3 deployment planning.
