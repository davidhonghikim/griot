# JUNZI Phase 6 - Detailed Technical Specification: Federated Governance Coordination Layer (FGCL)

## Module Name:

Federated Governance Coordination Layer (FGCL)

## Module Purpose:

FGCL provides the control and orchestration framework that binds together JUNZI’s decentralized, multi-node governance ecosystem. It manages distributed voting, policy dissemination, quorum tracking, inter-node synchronization, and multi-region governance event coordination, ensuring global ethical coherence and system-wide policy consistency.

---

## System Architecture

### Federated Governance Control Pipeline:

1. **Global Governance Event Bus:**

   - Facilitates real-time broadcasting of governance events across all JUNZI nodes.
   - Supports pub-sub architecture for governance modules (SVN, GESP, AREE, MERF, etc.).

2. **Quorum Management Engine:**

   - Tracks active quorum participation during federated voting and decision sessions.
   - Validates quorum fulfillment before vote finalization or safeguard trigger.

3. **Governance Policy Distribution Layer:**

   - Ensures consistent dissemination of new governance rules, policies, and thresholds to all participating nodes.
   - Handles version control and rollback for governance configuration files.

4. **Multi-Node Synchronization Service:**

   - Periodically reconciles governance state across nodes to prevent fragmentation or split-brain scenarios.
   - Triggers alerts if state divergence exceeds policy-defined thresholds.

5. **Governance Workflow Orchestrator:**

   - Coordinates time-bound governance processes (e.g., SVN voting windows, GESP activation ballots).
   - Provides countdown timers and deadline enforcement.

6. **Audit and Compliance Layer:**

   - Logs all governance actions, quorum counts, policy updates, and synchronization events into EAT and ELTE.

## Data Models

### Governance Event Record:

```json
{
  "event_id": "uuid",
  "event_type": "VoteStart | QuorumUpdate | PolicyUpdate | SafeguardBallot | SynchronizationAlert",
  "origin_node": "uuid",
  "payload": "JSON",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601",
  "status": "Pending | Completed | Failed"
}
```

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint                            | Method | Description                                        |
| ----------------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| /fgcl/broadcast-governance-event    | POST   | Sends governance event to all nodes                |
| /fgcl/get-quorum-status/{event\_id} | GET    | Returns quorum participation status                |
| /fgcl/distribute-policy-update      | POST   | Pushes new governance policies to all nodes        |
| /fgcl/get-governance-sync-status    | GET    | Returns current multi-node state alignment metrics |
| /fgcl/get-governance-event-history  | POST   | Lists past governance coordination events          |

## Algorithms and Logic

1. **Quorum Verification Logic:**

   - Validates that required node count and region diversity conditions are met for governance actions.

2. **Governance State Reconciliation Algorithm:**

   - Compares governance state hashes across nodes.
   - Flags divergence for manual or automated correction.

3. **Policy Rollback Controller:**

   - Provides rollback mechanisms for failed or contested governance updates.

---

## Performance Targets

- **Event Broadcast Latency:** Under 2 seconds global
- **Quorum Status Check Time:** Under 500ms
- **Policy Distribution Time:** Under 5 minutes for full global node propagation
- **Governance State Drift Detection:** Under 1 minute per check cycle

---

## Monitoring and Metrics

- **Event Broadcast Success Rate**
- **Quorum Fulfillment Time**
- **State Divergence Frequency**
- **Policy Update Propagation Time**

Monitoring Tools: Prometheus + Grafana; Governance Health dashboards.

---

## Security Considerations

- Signed governance event payloads for tamper resistance
- RBAC for governance API access
- TLS encryption for inter-node traffic
- Full audit logging for all governance events

---

## Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests:**

  - Quorum validation logic
  - State hash comparison functions

- **Integration Tests:**

  - FGCL ↔ SVN, GESP, AREE, MERF, ELTE, EAT coordination flows

- **Load Tests:**

  - High-frequency event broadcasting

- **Disaster Recovery Tests:**

  - Simulated partial node loss during active governance sessions

---

## Deployment Profile

- **Language:** GoLang or Python 3.11
- **Containerization:** Docker + Kubernetes
- **Storage:** PostgreSQL for governance event logs; Redis for real-time quorum tracking

---
