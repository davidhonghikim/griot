# JUNZI Phase 7 - Detailed Technical Specification: AI-Human Co-Ethics Review Interface (AHCRI)

## Module Name:

AI-Human Co-Ethics Review Interface (AHCRI)

## Module Purpose:

AHCRI serves as JUNZI’s primary interface for collaborative ethical deliberation between human governance board members and AI advisory agents. It facilitates transparent, explainable, and interactive co-governance during ethical decision reviews, incident investigations, and rule evolution discussions.

---

## System Architecture

### Co-Ethics Interaction Pipeline:

1. **Multi-Agent Input Aggregator:**

   - Collects decision rationales from:
     - JEDE (ethical decision logs)
     - AECGI (AI advisory responses)
     - SFL (stakeholder feedback logs)
     - PASv2 (simulation results)

2. **Human Review Dashboard:**

   - Provides human board members with:
     - Ethical decision histories
     - Active AI advisory summaries
     - Stakeholder impact forecasts
     - Voting history from SVN

3. **Interactive Deliberation Module:**

   - Allows humans and AI agents to:
     - Submit discussion comments
     - Run what-if simulations
     - Request new risk forecasts from ERFE

4. **Explainability Layer:**

   - Provides:
     - XAI (Explainable AI) decision breakdowns
     - Model feature importance visualizations
     - Counterfactual reasoning scenarios

5. **Deliberation Logging and Archival Service:**

   - Records all discussion threads, comments, decision outcomes, and rationale changes into EAT and ELTE.

6. **Consensus Recommendation Engine:**

   - Calculates:
     - Level of alignment between AI and human viewpoints
     - Governance consensus scores

7. **Post-Review Action Orchestrator:**

   - Pushes finalized human-approved actions to:
     - DERE (rule updates)
     - JEDE (decision adjustments)
     - SVN (if new votes are required)

## Data Models

### Co-Ethics Deliberation Record:

```json
{
  "deliberation_id": "uuid",
  "related_decision_id": "uuid",
  "participants": ["HumanBoardMember", "AIAdvisor"],
  "discussion_threads": "JSON",
  "final_outcome": "Approved | Modified | Rejected | Deferred",
  "consensus_score": "float",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601"
}
```

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint                                           | Method | Description                                              |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| /ahcri/start-deliberation                          | POST   | Initiates a new co-ethics review session                 |
| /ahcri/submit-comment/{deliberation\_id}           | POST   | Submits human or AI input into ongoing review            |
| /ahcri/get-deliberation-summary/{deliberation\_id} | GET    | Retrieves current deliberation status and comments       |
| /ahcri/request-ai-explanation/{decision\_id}       | GET    | Returns explainable AI rationale for specific decision   |
| /ahcri/finalize-deliberation/{deliberation\_id}    | POST   | Closes session and submits outcome to governance modules |

---

## Algorithms and Logic

1. **Consensus Scoring Algorithm:**

   - Calculates alignment level between human and AI participants.

2. **Explainability Generation Module:**

   - Uses LIME, SHAP, or custom XAI methods for feature importance and decision path visualization.

3. **Impact Forecast Query Orchestrator:**

   - Pulls latest stakeholder and risk forecasts during deliberation.

---

## Performance Targets

- **Deliberation Session Startup Time:** Under 30 seconds
- **XAI Report Generation Time:** Under 2 minutes
- **Comment Submission Latency:** Under 1 second

---

## Monitoring and Metrics

- **Deliberation Frequency**
- **Consensus Alignment Rate**
- **Average Deliberation Duration**
- **Post-Deliberation Policy Adjustment Rate**

Monitoring Tools: Prometheus + Grafana; Co-Ethics participation dashboards.

---

## Security Considerations

- RBAC for human participant roles
- AI advisory role enforcement via AECGI scope restrictions
- TLS encryption for all API traffic
- Full audit logging for all deliberation interactions (stored in EAT)

---

## Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests:**

  - Consensus calculation logic
  - XAI report generation

- **Integration Tests:**

  - AHCRI ↔ JEDE, DERE, SVN, PASv2, AECGI, SFL, EAT, ELTE data flows

- **Load Tests:**

  - High-concurrency deliberation session simulations

- **UI/UX Tests:**

  - Dashboard usability for human governance users

---

## Deployment Profile

- **Language:** Python 3.11 + Node.js (for UI dashboard)
- **Containerization:** Docker + Kubernetes
- **Storage:** PostgreSQL for deliberation logs; S3 for discussion artifacts

---

## Dependencies

- JEDE API
- DERE API
- SVN API
- PASv2 API
- AECGI API
- SFL API
- EAT API
- ELTE API
