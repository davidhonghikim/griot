# JUNZI Cross-Node Orchestration Plan

**Node Class:** JunziNode  
**System:** kOS Ecosystem  
**Document Type:** Multi-Node Coordination and Federation Strategy

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose:
To define how multiple JUNZI nodes will communicate, synchronize, and govern data integrity, bias mitigation, and ethical decision-making across a distributed, federated deployment model.

---

## âœ… Architectural Overview:
| Layer | Function |
|---|---|
| Local Node | Each JUNZI instance (university, NGO, media outlet) operates its own full stack (DB + API + Agents) |
| Federation Layer | Oversees inter-node communication, source validation consensus, and cross-node queries |
| Global Consensus Council | Provides ethical oversight and adjudication for inter-node disputes |

---

## âœ… Federation Communication Protocol:
| Protocol Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Transport Layer | gRPC or REST over HTTPS |
| Message Signing | Node-specific public/private key pairs |
| Data Consistency Model | Eventual consistency with periodic state reconciliation |
| Source Trust Voting | Weighted quorum-based source reliability scoring |
| Dispute Escalation | Automatic notification to Global Consensus Council for flagged disputes |

---

## âœ… Cross-Node APIs:
| API | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/federation/sync_state` | Exchange current entity states and contradiction logs |
| `/federation/vote_source` | Participate in source reliability scoring votes |
| `/federation/escalate_dispute` | Escalate entity risk or contradiction disputes for council review |
| `/federation/heartbeat` | Report node uptime and health to federation registry |

---

## âœ… Governance Safeguards:
- Every node must publish a public node manifest declaring:
  - Ownership
  - Hosting jurisdiction
  - Ethical governance alignment
- Federation-wide bias audits run quarterly
- Inter-node data corruption triggers automatic quarantine of offending node until manual review

---

## âœ… Node Joining Protocol:
| Step | Action |
|---|---|
| 1 | Submit Node Registration Request with Governance Compliance Checklist |
| 2 | Undergo Security and Ethical Vetting by existing nodes |
| 3 | Complete Test Federation Sync with dummy data |
| 4 | Receive Node Signing Key from Federation Council |
| 5 | Enter Federation with read-only access for first 30 days (probation) |

---

## âœ… Disaster Recovery & Federation Resilience:
- Redundant data sync paths
- Failover node selection algorithm
- Auto-healing federation state reconciliation
- Distributed audit log archival (multi-node redundancy)

---

**This document now serves as the canonical Cross-Node Orchestration Plan for JUNZI federation deployments within the kOS ecosystem until formally revised.**
