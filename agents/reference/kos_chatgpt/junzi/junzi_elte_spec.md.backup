# JUNZI Phase 6 - Detailed Technical Specification: Ethical Legacy Threading Engine (ELTE)

## Module Name:

Ethical Legacy Threading Engine (ELTE)

## Module Purpose:

ELTE ensures long-term ethical continuity, decision lineage preservation, and intergenerational traceability of all rule evolutions, ethical decisions, stakeholder value shifts, and governance actions across JUNZI’s global deployment network. It embeds historical context into future decision flows and supports ethical transparency across decades.

---

## System Architecture

### Ethical Threading Pipeline:

1. **Lineage Capture Layer:**

   - Captures metadata for:
     - Every rule change (from IRRL)
     - Every SVN vote result
     - Every JEDE ethical decision outcome (at summary level)
     - Every stakeholder impact recalibration (from SIRE)

2. **Temporal Contextualizer:**

   - Organizes historical data into time-segmented ethical eras (e.g., Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly epochs).
   - Tags decisions and rules with ethical generation identifiers.

3. **Intergenerational Linking Engine:**

   - Builds backward and forward linkage graphs:
     - Rule derivation chains
     - Ethical impact lineage
     - Stakeholder sentiment evolution paths

4. **Legacy Trace Query API:**

   - Allows retrieval of:
     - Rule evolution trees
     - Decision lineage chains
     - Governance history timelines

5. **Historical Context Injection Module:**

   - Feeds JEDE with time-weighted ethical historical context during complex decision scenarios.
   - Supports bias correction and legacy-aware decision reasoning.

6. **Ethical Era Summarization Engine:**

   - Generates human-readable summaries of each ethical era for governance and stakeholder transparency.

7. **Integrity Validation Layer:**

   - Runs cryptographic hash-based consistency checks on the entire historical thread chain.

## Data Models

### Ethical Legacy Thread Record:

```json
{
  "thread_id": "uuid",
  "origin_event_type": "RuleChange | VoteOutcome | DecisionOutcome | StakeholderRecalibration",
  "origin_event_id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601",
  "ethical_era": "string (e.g., Q1_2025)",
  "linked_threads": ["uuid"],
  "summary": "string",
  "integrity_hash": "sha256"
}
```

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint                              | Method | Description                                             |
| ------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| /elte/record-thread                   | POST   | Creates a new ethical legacy thread record              |
| /elte/get-lineage/{event\_id}         | GET    | Retrieves full lineage chain for a given event          |
| /elte/get-era-summary/{ethical\_era}  | GET    | Returns high-level summary for an ethical era           |
| /elte/run-integrity-check             | POST   | Executes full-chain integrity validation                |
| /elte/get-thread-history/{thread\_id} | GET    | Returns chronological thread history for a lineage node |

---

## Algorithms and Logic

1. **Temporal Epoch Assignment Algorithm:**

   - Dynamically assigns ethical era IDs based on governance-defined time boundaries.

2. **Graph-Based Linkage Builder:**

   - Uses directed acyclic graph (DAG) modeling for thread linkage.

3. **Integrity Verification Algorithm:**

   - SHA256 or SHA3 hash chains for lineage tamper detection.

---

## Performance Targets

- **Thread Recording Latency:** Under 100ms per event
- **Lineage Query Latency:** Under 500ms
- **Integrity Check Completion Time:** Under 10 minutes for full system scan

---

## Monitoring and Metrics

- **Thread Record Growth Rate**
- **Integrity Check Failure Rate**
- **Lineage Query Volume**
- **Ethical Era Summary Generation Frequency**

Monitoring Tools: Prometheus + Grafana; Legacy thread health dashboards.

---

## Security Considerations

- Append-only storage for lineage records
- Full audit logging for all thread creation and query events
- TLS encryption for API communication
- Governance-locked access to lineage modification functions (only append allowed)

---

## Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests:**

  - Graph linkage consistency
  - Temporal assignment accuracy

- **Integration Tests:**

  - ELTE ↔ JEDE, DERE, SVN, SIRE, EAT communication flows

- **Load Tests:**

  - High-frequency thread record creation

- **Integrity Stress Tests:**

  - Simulated tampering detection

---

## Deployment Profile

- **Language:** Python 3.11 or GoLang (for high-speed graph processing)
- **Containerization:** Docker + Kubernetes
- **Storage:** PostgreSQL for metadata; optional Neo4j or TigerGraph for lineage graph storage

---

## Dependencies

- IRRL API
- SVN API
- JEDE API
- SIRE API
- EAT API
