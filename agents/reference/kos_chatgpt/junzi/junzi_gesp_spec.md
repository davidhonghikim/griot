# JUNZI Phase 6 - Detailed Technical Specification: Global Ethics Safeguard Protocol (GESP)

## Module Name:

Global Ethics Safeguard Protocol (GESP)

## Module Purpose:

GESP provides JUNZI with a system-wide emergency fail-safe mechanism to detect, contain, and neutralize ethical system failures, catastrophic drift events, and large-scale governance malfunctions. It allows for human-initiated or autonomous trigger-based full-system lockdown, rollback, and recovery procedures.

---

## System Architecture

### Safeguard Activation Pipeline:

1. **Global Risk Signal Monitor:**

   - Continuously monitors inputs from:
     - ERFE (Risk Forecasts)
     - EDDG (Drift Anomalies)
     - AMRE (Failed Mitigations)
     - EAT (Incident Volume Thresholds)
     - JEDE (Decision Anomaly Density)

2. **Safeguard Threshold Engine:**

   - Calculates cumulative Ethical System Risk Score (ESRS).
   - Triggers pre-activation alerts when ESRS exceeds warning thresholds.

3. **Activation Decision Layer:**

   - Supports activation through:
     - Multi-node quorum-based governance votes
     - Manual override by the Global Safeguard Authority (GSA)
     - Automated trigger on extreme ESRS levels

4. **System-Wide Containment Module:**

   - Executes:
     - Real-time halt of all JEDE decision-making flows
     - Global DERE rule change freeze
     - SFL stakeholder communication lockdown
     - Temporary suspension of AREE-driven rule updates

5. **Ethical Rollback Engine:**

   - Reverts all JUNZI modules to last known stable ethical baseline.
   - Targets rollback window: last 24 to 72 hours by default.

6. **Recovery Orchestration Layer:**

   - Stages:
     - System health assessment
     - Stakeholder re-engagement
     - Gradual restart of JEDE, DERE, and SFL flows post-verification

7. **Safeguard Logging and Audit Trail:**

   - Logs every safeguard trigger, decision, and recovery step in EAT.

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint                     | Method | Description                                                               |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| /gesp/get-esrs               | GET    | Returns current Ethical System Risk Score                                 |
| /gesp/trigger-safeguard      | POST   | Initiates a safeguard event (requires governance key or threshold breach) |
| /gesp/get-activation-history | POST   | Returns historical safeguard activations                                  |
| /gesp/rollback-system        | POST   | Starts ethical rollback to last safe state                                |
| /gesp/start-recovery         | POST   | Begins phased recovery sequence post-containment                          |

## Algorithms and Logic

1. **Ethical Risk Scoring Algorithm:**

   - ESRS formula weights drift anomalies, risk forecast spikes, decision anomalies, and failed mitigations.

2. **Safeguard Threshold Policy:**

   - Configurable ESRS thresholds for Warning, Critical, and Auto-Trigger levels.

3. **Rollback Point Selector:**

   - Chooses safest rollback checkpoint based on drift and incident data density.

---

## Performance Targets

- **Detection-to-Activation Latency:** Under 2 minutes for automated triggers
- **System Freeze Latency:** Under 1 minute post-activation
- **Rollback Execution Time:** Under 15 minutes for global multi-node network

---

## Monitoring and Metrics

- **ESRS Trendline**
- **Safeguard Activation Frequency**
- **Rollback Success Rate**
- **Recovery Time Metrics**

Monitoring Tools: Prometheus + Grafana; Safeguard Health and ESRS dashboards.

---

## Security Considerations

- Multi-party governance key approval for manual activations
- Real-time tamper alerts for safeguard configuration changes
- Full audit trail in EAT for all safeguard-related actions
- TLS encryption for all API calls
