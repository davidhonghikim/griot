# JUNZI Phase 2 - Detailed Technical Specification: Integration and Deployment Infrastructure

## Module Name:
Integration and Deployment Infrastructure (IDI)

## Module Purpose:
The IDI provides the centralized infrastructure for orchestrating the deployment, scaling, communication, and runtime management of all Phase 2 JUNZI modules. It ensures reliable, secure, and efficient execution of inter-module workflows and system-wide coordination.

---

## System Architecture

### Core Infrastructure Components:

1. **API Gateway:**
   - Unified entry point for all external and internal API calls.
   - Features:
     - Request routing
     - Load balancing
     - Rate limiting
     - Authentication enforcement
   - Recommended Frameworks: Kong Gateway, Amazon API Gateway, or Envoy Proxy

2. **Service Discovery Layer:**
   - Dynamic detection of module service endpoints (JEDE, DERE, CTI, VTL, etc.).
   - Supports horizontal scaling with auto-registration and deregistration.
   - Tooling: Consul, Eureka, or Kubernetes-native service discovery.

3. **Inter-Service Communication Bus:**
   - Enables asynchronous messaging and event-driven workflows between modules.
   - Message brokers supported: RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, or NATS.

4. **Container Orchestration Platform:**
   - Kubernetes (K8s)-based orchestration.
   - Features:
     - Horizontal Pod Auto-Scaling (HPA)
     - Resource Quotas
     - Node Affinity Rules

5. **CI/CD Pipeline:**
   - Automates build, test, deployment, and rollback processes for all modules.
   - Recommended Tools:
     - Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions
     - Helm for Kubernetes deployment templating

6. **Configuration Management:**
   - Centralized management of environment variables, secrets, and deployment profiles.
   - Tools: HashiCorp Vault (for secrets), ConfigMaps and Secrets (K8s-native).

7. **Monitoring and Logging Stack:**
   - System-wide observability for all JUNZI services.
   - Metrics: Prometheus + Grafana
   - Logging: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Loki + Grafana

## Deployment Topology

### Recommended Cluster Layout:
- **Namespace Segmentation:** One K8s namespace per environment (Dev, Staging, Production)
- **Pod Distribution:**
  - Separate pods for each module (JEDE, DERE, CTI, etc.)
  - Horizontal scaling enabled for JEDE, RAME, and CAM (high-traffic modules)
- **Node Pools:**
  - General Compute
  - ML/AI Workloads (for VTL, RAME ML models)
  - Storage-Optimized Nodes (for EAT and SFL data persistence)

---

## Deployment Process Workflow

1. **Code Commit:**
   - Triggers automated CI pipeline.

2. **Build Stage:**
   - Containerization via Dockerfiles.
   - Image scanning for vulnerabilities.

3. **Test Stage:**
   - Unit tests and module-level integration tests executed.

4. **Deployment Stage:**
   - Helm charts applied for target environment.
   - Automated health checks post-deployment.

5. **Post-Deployment Monitoring:**
   - Immediate feedback via Prometheus and Grafana dashboards.
   - Rollback triggered automatically on critical failure thresholds.

---

## Security Considerations
- **API Authentication:** OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect enforced at API Gateway level.
- **Inter-Service Encryption:** mTLS (Mutual TLS) for all service-to-service traffic.
- **Secret Management:** HashiCorp Vault or K8s Secrets encrypted with customer-managed keys.
- **Audit Trails:** All deployment actions logged and linked to EAT for traceability.

---

## Performance Targets
- **Average Deployment Time:** Under 5 minutes per environment push.
- **Service Discovery Propagation Delay:** Under 1 second.
- **Inter-Service API Call Latency:** Under 50ms internal (p95).
- **CI/CD Pipeline Success Rate:** > 95% on first-attempt builds.

---

## Monitoring and Metrics
- **Pod Health Status Across Modules**
- **API Error Rate by Endpoint**
- **Deployment Success/Failure Ratio**
- **Inter-Service Latency Trends**
- **Resource Utilization (CPU, Memory, Storage)**

---

## Testing Requirements
- **Infrastructure Smoke Tests:**
  - Service discovery
  - API Gateway routing

- **Load Tests:**
  - Concurrent API calls across all modules

- **Failure Injection Tests:**
  - Network partition scenarios
  - Module crash-recovery workflows

- **Security Tests:**
  - Unauthorized access prevention
  - Secrets leakage checks

---

## Dependencies
- All Phase 2 JUNZI modules (JEDE, DERE, VTL, CTI, EAT, SFL, CAM, PAS, RAME)
- CI/CD tool of choice (Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions)
- Kubernetes Cluster (self-hosted or managed, e.g., GKE, EKS, AKS)
