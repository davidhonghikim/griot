# JUNZI Phase 7 - Detailed Technical Specification: AI Lifecycle Management System (ALMS)

## Module Name:

AI Lifecycle Management System (ALMS)

## Module Purpose:

ALMS manages the full lifecycle of all machine learning models, reasoning engines, and forecasting tools within JUNZI. It ensures that deployed AI components remain accurate, bias-mitigated, timely retrained, securely versioned, and fully auditable throughout their operational lifespan.

---

## System Architecture

### AI Lifecycle Management Pipeline:

1. **Model Registry and Metadata Store:**

   - Tracks all AI models, including:
     - Model name and version
     - Training dataset details
     - Hyperparameter configurations
     - Deployment timestamps

2. **Bias and Drift Detection Engine:**

   - Continuously monitors for:
     - Model output drift (via PSI, KS-Tests)
     - Ethical bias detection (using fairness metrics like Demographic Parity, Equalized Odds)

3. **Model Retraining Scheduler:**

   - Automatically triggers retraining jobs when:
     - Drift thresholds are exceeded
     - New ethical training data becomes available
     - Scheduled retraining windows are reached (e.g., quarterly)

4. **Versioning and Rollback Controller:**

   - Supports deployment of:
     - Blue/Green models
     - Canary releases
     - Rollback to last known good model

5. **Performance Evaluation Suite:**

   - Calculates post-deployment metrics:
     - Precision / Recall / F1
     - Fairness metrics
     - Ethical Risk Scores

6. **Deployment Orchestrator:**

   - Automates rollout of updated models across relevant JUNZI modules (JEDE, ERFE, PASv2, etc.).

7. **Audit and Governance Layer:**

   - Logs all model changes, evaluations, and deployments into EAT and ELTE.

  "rollback_point": "boolean"
}
```

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint                                      | Method | Description                                      |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| /alms/register-model                          | POST   | Registers a new AI model version                 |
| /alms/get-model-metadata/{model\_id}          | GET    | Retrieves model metadata and performance metrics |
| /alms/trigger-retraining/{model\_id}          | POST   | Initiates retraining for a specific model        |
| /alms/rollback-model/{model\_id}              | POST   | Rolls back deployment to a previous version      |
| /alms/get-drift-monitoring-status/{model\_id} | GET    | Returns drift and bias monitoring results        |

## Algorithms and Logic

1. **Drift Detection Algorithms:**

   - Population Stability Index (PSI)
   - KS-Test for distribution shift detection

2. **Bias Detection Framework:**

   - Fairlearn or AIF360 for fairness and bias monitoring

3. **Retraining Trigger Logic:**

   - Combines scheduled triggers, drift alerts, and ethical performance metrics.

4. **Rollback Safety Validator:**

   - Ensures rollback targets passed last known compliance checks.

---

## Performance Targets

- **Retraining Job Start Latency:** Under 15 minutes from trigger
- **Drift Detection Frequency:** Every 6 hours (configurable)
- **Rollback Execution Time:** Under 5 minutes

---

## Monitoring and Metrics

- **Drift Alert Rate**
- **Retraining Frequency**
- **Model Deployment Success Rate**
- **Rollback Event Frequency**

Monitoring Tools: Prometheus + Grafana; Model lifecycle dashboards.

---

## Security Considerations

- Role-based access control for deployment and rollback
- Full audit logging for all lifecycle events (stored in EAT)
- Secure storage of model artifacts (S3 or MinIO)
- Version immutability once deployed

---

## Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests:**

  - Drift calculation logic
  - Bias metric evaluation

- **Integration Tests:**

  - ALMS â†” JEDE, ERFE, PASv2, EAT, ELTE communication flows
