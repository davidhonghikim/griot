# JUNZI Test Case Templates for System Validation

**Node Class:** JunziNode  
**System:** kOS Ecosystem  
**Testing Focus:** Agent functionality, API integrity, bias audits, data provenance, and cross-node communication.

---

## ✅ 1. Agent-Level Unit Test Cases

### ContradictionScannerAgent
| Test Case | Description |
|---|---|
| CS-001 | Validate detection of a clear contradiction between two known public statements |
| CS-002 | Ensure false positives remain under defined threshold using control dataset |
| CS-003 | Confirm all contradiction reports include timestamp, entity ID, and source references |

### RiskProfilerAgent
| Test Case | Description |
|---|---|
| RP-001 | Generate risk score for entity with multiple flagged contradictions |
| RP-002 | Check score re-calculation after new data input |
| RP-003 | Verify attached bias audit metadata exists for every score output |

### JurisdictionContextAgent
| Test Case | Description |
|---|---|
| JC-001 | Classify sample data by correct jurisdiction (local, state, federal) |
| JC-002 | Confirm that multi-jurisdictional records are tagged with all relevant contexts |

### BiasAuditAgent
| Test Case | Description |
|---|---|
| BA-001 | Inject known biased input and confirm bias detection triggers |
| BA-002 | Verify bias audit logs are attached to all AI-generated risk scores |
| BA-003 | Ensure multi-model consensus check completes within timeout threshold |

### PromiseTrackerAgent
| Test Case | Description |
|---|---|
| PT-001 | Detect promise in a campaign speech transcript |
| PT-002 | Update promise status when an action fulfilling it is recorded |
| PT-003 | Validate long-term tracking across multiple data ingestion cycles |

### SourceAttributionAgent
| Test Case | Description |
|---|---|
| SA-001 | Confirm that all incoming data is tagged with immutable source hashes |
| SA-002 | Validate cross-reference accuracy between source ID and stored original |

### PublicExposureAgent
| Test Case | Description |
|---|---|
| PE-001 | Trigger public alert for high-risk score entity |
| PE-002 | Validate rate limiting on public API burst traffic |
| PE-003 | Confirm all public-facing data includes required provenance metadata |

---

## ✅ 2. Integration Test Cases (Cross-Agent and Cross-Node)

| Test Case | Description |
|---|---|
| INT-001 | Full data flow: Ingest → Process → Contradiction → Risk Profile → GriotNode handoff |
| INT-002 | High-severity contradiction triggers OracleNode risk prediction sequence |
| INT-003 | Archived contradiction reports visible in YachayNode historical query API |
| INT-004 | Test emergency escalation: MusaNode receives critical integrity breach notification |

---

## ✅ 3. API Endpoint Test Cases

| Endpoint | Test Cases |
|---|---|
| `/entities/{id}/profile` | Fetch valid profile, 404 on nonexistent entity, data field validation |
| `/entities/{id}/contradictions` | Return correct contradiction count, verify source links, pagination |
| `/risk_scores/` | Filter by jurisdiction, risk level, validate score sorting |
| `/promises/{entity_id}` | Correct promise count, status flags accurate, source references correct |
| `/alerts/` | Recent alerts only, high-confidence filtering, API response time under threshold |
| `/sources/{source_id}` | Source exists, correct hash, integrity check passes |

---

## ✅ 4. Bias Audit Validation Tests

| Test Case | Description |
|---|---|
| BA-VAL-001 | Submit known politically charged dataset → Confirm bias mitigation triggers |
| BA-VAL-002 | Compare outputs between model A and model B for fairness spread |
| BA-VAL-003 | Test bias audit override fails without admin authorization |

---

## ✅ 5. Data Provenance Verification Tests

| Test Case | Description |
|---|---|
| DP-001 | Trace arbitrary data output back to original ingestion source |
| DP-002 | Tamper with source tag → Verify system flags as integrity violation |
| DP-003 | Confirm all cross-node data retains unbroken source hash lineage |

---

## ✅ Summary:
This suite forms the baseline test case template for **agent unit testing**, **node integration testing**, **public API validation**, **bias auditing**, and **data provenance enforcement** for JUNZI within the kOS ecosystem.

**All agent teams and QA engineers must expand these into full executable test suites per project phase.**
