# JUNZI System Resilience and Disaster Recovery Plan

**Node Class:** JunziNode  
**System:** kOS Ecosystem  
**Document Type:** Operational Resilience Strategy

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Mission:
To ensure that JUNZI remains operational, secure, and recoverable in the face of cyberattacks, infrastructure failures, data corruption, or natural disasters.

---

## âœ… Resilience Strategy Components:

| Layer | Strategy |
|---|---|
| **Infrastructure Redundancy** | Deploy JUNZINode instances across multiple geographic data centers and availability zones |
| **Auto-Scaling** | Leverage kOS orchestration with HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaling) for load balancing during traffic spikes |
| **Failover Mechanisms** | Automatic failover between primary and secondary nodes for high availability |
| **Real-Time Monitoring** | Integrate with kOS Monitoring Layer for heartbeat checks, uptime metrics, and anomaly detection |

---

## âœ… Disaster Recovery (DR) Protocols:

### Tiered Recovery Framework:
| DR Tier | Scenario | Target Recovery Time Objective (RTO) | Target Recovery Point Objective (RPO) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tier 1: Critical Outage** | Full node failure or security breach | < 1 hour | < 15 minutes |
| **Tier 2: Data Corruption** | Database integrity loss | < 4 hours | < 30 minutes |
| **Tier 3: Regional Infrastructure Failure** | Data center or cloud provider outage | < 12 hours | < 1 hour |
| **Tier 4: Total Catastrophic Failure** | Multi-region loss (disaster scenario) | < 24 hours | < 2 hours |

---

### Backup and Replication Strategy:
| Type | Frequency | Storage Location |
|---|---|---|
| Incremental Data Snapshots | Every 15 minutes | Multi-region object storage |
| Full Node Configuration Backups | Nightly | Secure VaultNode clusters |
| AI Model Weights and Pipelines | Weekly | Separate artifact repository |
| API State and Routing Rules | Real-time sync | Secondary OrchestratorNode |

---

## âœ… Cybersecurity & Tamper Protection:
| Control | Description |
|---|---|
| Immutable Audit Logs | All logs written with append-only permission and stored in VaultNode |
| Tamper Detection Agents | Continuous hash-checking of critical configuration and model weights |
| Security Event Escalation | Automatic alert to GuardianNode and MusaNode on any unauthorized config change |
| Rate Limiting & IP Throttling | Prevent denial-of-service or scraping abuse on JUNZI public APIs |

---

## âœ… Post-Recovery Integrity Verification:
- All restored services undergo full integrity check from the **SourceAttributionAgent**
- Bias audit runs on all critical models post-recovery
- Manual human approval required before re-enabling public alert endpoints

---

## âœ… Communication Protocol During Outages:
| Stakeholder | Notification Method |
|---|---|
| Internal kOS Ops Teams | PagerDuty / Slack / Email Immediate Alerts |
| Public Users | Temporary system status page via CommunicatorNode |
| Media / Press | Prepared outage notification statements, embargoed until cause analysis |

---

**This document now serves as the canonical System Resilience and Disaster Recovery Plan for JUNZI operations within the kOS ecosystem until formally revised.**
