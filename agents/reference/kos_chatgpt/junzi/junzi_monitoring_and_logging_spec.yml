# JUNZI Monitoring and Logging Specification

**Node Class:** JunziNode  
**System:** kOS Ecosystem  
**Document Type:** Operational Monitoring and Logging Framework

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose:
To define how JUNZI services, agents, and APIs will be monitored in real-time and how all system activities will be logged for observability, auditing, and anomaly detection.

---

## âœ… Monitoring Stack:

| Layer | Tool/Framework |
|---|---|
| Metrics Collection | Prometheus |
| Visualization | Grafana Dashboards |
| Log Aggregation | ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Loki (if using Grafana Cloud) |
| Alerting | Prometheus Alertmanager or Grafana Alerts |
| Agent Health Monitoring | Custom heartbeat checkers per JUNZI Agent |

---

## âœ… Monitoring Metrics:

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| API Latency | Track average and 95th percentile API response times |
| Error Rates | 4xx and 5xx error codes per endpoint |
| Contradiction Detection Rate | Number of contradictions flagged per time period |
| Risk Score Drift | Changes in risk scoring patterns over time |
| Bias Audit Failure Rate | Number of bias audit flags per deployment |
| Data Ingestion Volume | Number of new data points processed per hour |
| User Report Volume | Number of incoming user-submitted reports |
| Queue Backlog | Pending jobs in contradiction scanning pipeline |

---

## âœ… Logging Standards:

| Standard | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Format | JSON structured logs |
| Log Levels | DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL |
| Trace IDs | Unique request/operation IDs for tracing end-to-end flows |
| Redaction | No PII logged unless explicitly permitted and encrypted |
| Persistence | All logs stored for 180 days minimum in VaultNode-controlled storage |
| Agent-Specific Prefix | Every log line should include agent and node identifiers (e.g., `[JUNZI-RiskProfilerAgent]`) |

---

## âœ… Alerting Rules:

| Alert Condition | Trigger Threshold |
|---|---|
| High API Error Rate | >5% 5xx errors over 5 minutes |
| Bias Audit Spike | >10 failed bias audits in 30 minutes |
| Agent Crash | Missed heartbeat for any agent for >60 seconds |
| Data Ingestion Failure | No new data processed in >30 minutes |
| Risk Score Anomaly | Risk score distribution deviates >3Ïƒ from historical norm |

---

## âœ… Dashboard Views:

| Dashboard | Focus |
|---|---|
| System Health | Node uptime, container statuses, API availability |
| Agent Performance | Job durations, queue backlog, error counts per agent |
| Public API Usage | API request volumes, rate limits, top endpoints by traffic |
| Risk Metrics | Entity risk distribution, risk score change frequency |
| Contradiction Trends | Detected contradictions over time by jurisdiction |

---

## âœ… Compliance:
- All logging and monitoring data governed by HIEROS data protection policies.
- Sensitive data logs encrypted at rest.
- Access to production logs limited to authorized roles with audit trail.

**This document now serves as the canonical Monitoring and Logging Spec for JUNZI operations within the kOS ecosystem until formally revised.**
