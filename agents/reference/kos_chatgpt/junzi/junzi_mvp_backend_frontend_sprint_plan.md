# JUNZI MVP Backend + Frontend Sprint Plan

**Node Class:** JunziNode  
**System:** kOS Ecosystem  
**Document Type:** Development Sprint Breakdown (MVP Phase)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Sprint Goal:
Deliver a functional MVP of JUNZI with core backend APIs, frontend UI screens, and end-to-end data flow for public testing and internal evaluation.

---

## Team Size Assumption:
Solo developer OR small team (2-4 contributors)

---

## ðŸ“… Sprint Timeline: (4 Weeks Total â€“ 2 Sprints)

### **Sprint 1 (Weeks 1â€“2): Backend Foundation + API Layer**

| Task | Description |
|---|---|
| Setup Project Repos | Initialize Git, CI/CD pipelines, and development environments |
| Database Schema | Design and implement JUNZI data models (Entities, Contradictions, Risk Scores, Promises, Alerts) |
| API Routing | Scaffold all public JUNZI API endpoints defined in the OpenAPI Spec |
| Core Agent Logic | Implement ContradictionScannerAgent, RiskProfilerAgent, SourceAttributionAgent (basic versions) |
| BiasAudit Stubs | Add stub logic for BiasAuditAgent (full logic to come in Phase 2) |
| Dev Environment Config | Create Docker Compose / local env setup for easy backend testing |
| Basic Unit Tests | Write unit tests for at least 3 core API endpoints |

---

### **Sprint 2 (Weeks 3â€“4): Frontend UI + Integration Testing**

| Task | Description |
|---|---|
| UI Framework Setup | Configure Next.js / React frontend scaffolding |
| Implement UI Pages | Build UI per Wireframes Guide: Home, Entity Profile, Contradictions Feed, Risk Leaderboard, Promise Tracker, Alerts, User Submission Portal |
| API Integration | Connect frontend to backend API for live data population |
| Pagination & Filters | Implement query params and filters for entity search, contradictions, and risk feeds |
| Authentication Layer | Basic API key security for public API access |
| User Submission Flow | Full POST /user_reports/ frontend form integration |
| Frontend Error Handling | Graceful error states for API failures |
| Frontend Unit Tests | Add Jest/Cypress tests for frontend pages |
| End-to-End Testing | Full test from data ingest â†’ contradiction â†’ API â†’ frontend display |

---

## âœ… Sprint Deliverables:
- Working JUNZI API deployed to test server
- Fully navigable frontend UI with live data
- End-to-end pipeline for contradiction detection and risk profiling (MVP logic)
- Minimal production readiness: basic logging, rate limiting, and monitoring hooks

**This sprint plan serves as the canonical MVP build sequence for JUNZI until formally revised.**
