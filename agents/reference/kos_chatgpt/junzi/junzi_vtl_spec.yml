# JUNZI Phase 2 - Detailed Technical Specification: Values Translation Layer (VTL)

## Module Name:

Values Translation Layer (VTL)

## Module Purpose:

The VTL transforms high-level ethical policies, stakeholder value statements, and regulatory guidelines into machine-readable, executable rule sets deployable within the Dynamic Ethical Rule Engine (DERE). It acts as the semantic and logic bridge between human ethical language and operational decision logic.

---

## System Architecture

### Processing Pipeline:

1. **Policy Ingestion Layer:**

   - Accepts input in natural language, structured documents (PDF, DOCX, JSON), or direct API submissions.

2. **Preprocessing Layer:**

   - Runs tokenization, stopword removal, and syntactic parsing (using spaCy or NLTK libraries).

3. **Semantic Understanding Engine:**

   - Applies Natural Language Understanding (NLU) models fine-tuned on ethical, legal, and regulatory corpora.
   - Identifies ethical principles, constraints, stakeholders, and action triggers.

4. **Ontology Mapper:**

   - Aligns extracted elements to JUNZIâ€™s Ethical Ontology Model (from Phase 1 outputs).
   - Handles entity resolution, term disambiguation, and context classification.

5. **Rule Generator:**

   - Converts mapped elements into structured, executable rules in YAML or JSON formats.
   - Supports generation of rule metadata: priority weights, conflict tags, stakeholder relevance indexes.

6. **Simulation Validator:**

   - Runs generated rules through simulated scenarios using PAS (Policy and Action Simulator) to detect conflicts or inconsistencies before deployment.

7. **Export Handler:**

   - Pushes validated rule sets to DERE for version-controlled storage and future deployment.

---

## Supported Input Formats:

- PDF
- DOCX
- Plain Text
- JSON Policy Documents
- Direct REST API Calls

---

## Data Output Model:

```json
{
  "rule_id": "uuid",
  "description": "string",
  "priority_weight": "float",
  "stakeholder_scope": ["stakeholder_group_id"],
  "trigger_conditions": "logic expression",
  "action_constraints": "list of allowed/denied actions",
  "created_from_policy": "UUID or filename",
  "validation_status": "Pending | Validated | Failed",
  "version": "string"
}
```

---

## Core Algorithms and Models

1. **Ethical Intent Recognition Model:**

   - Transformer-based NLU model fine-tuned on ethics-specific corpora.

2. **Context-Aware Semantic Mapping:**

   - Custom mapping layer utilizing JUNZI Ethical Ontology for entity linking and context placement.

3. **Rule Synthesis Engine:**

   - Converts semantic frames into logical operator chains compatible with DERE rule syntax.

4. **Conflict Detection Pre-check:**

   - Runs generated rule candidates against known historical conflict patterns in EAT and DERE.

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint            | Method | Description                                         |
| ------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| /vtl/ingest-policy  | POST   | Uploads new ethical policy document for parsing     |
| /vtl/generate-rule  | POST   | Triggers rule generation from stored semantic frame |
| /vtl/validate-rule  | POST   | Runs simulation validation for a generated rule     |
| /vtl/export-to-dere | POST   | Exports validated rules to DERE storage             |
| /vtl/ontology-map   | GET    | Returns current ethical ontology term mappings      |

---

## Performance Targets

- **Policy-to-Rule Conversion Time:** Under 2 minutes for standard policy documents (<10 pages).
- **Ontology Mapping Accuracy:** >95% alignment rate with ethical ontology categories.
- **Rule Validation False Negative Rate:** <3%

---

## Logging and Monitoring

- **Policy Processing Logs:** Tracks ingestion time, NLP processing metrics, and semantic parsing results.
- **Rule Generation Metrics:** Counts generated rules per document.
- **Conflict Detection Alerts:** Triggers notifications for rule conflicts detected pre-deployment.
- **Ontology Mapping Health:** Regular sync and validation checks against master ontology.

Monitoring Tools: ElasticSearch + Kibana stack recommended for NLP and pipeline monitoring.

---

## Security Considerations

- API Key-based access control for ingestion endpoints
- PII Redaction Pipeline for sensitive policy documents
- Encrypted storage for policy inputs and generated rule drafts

---

## Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests:**

  - NLP extraction accuracy
  - Ontology mapping consistency

- **Integration Tests:**

  - End-to-end policy ingestion to DERE deployment

- **Ethical Validation Tests:**

  - Simulated ethical scenario checks using PAS

- **Performance Tests:**

  - Ingestion throughput under load

---

## Deployment Profile

- **Language:** Python 3.11
- **ML Libraries:** Hugging Face Transformers, spaCy, Scikit-learn
- **Containerization:** Docker + Kubernetes
- **Storage:** MongoDB or PostgreSQL for semantic frame storage

---

## Dependencies

- DERE API (for rule export)
- PAS API (for rule simulation testing)
- EAT API (for conflict pattern lookup)
- Ethical Ontology Service (for mapping)
