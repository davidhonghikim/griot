# JUNZI Phase 6 - Detailed Technical Specification: Autonomous Drift Containment Network (ADCN)

## Module Name:

Autonomous Drift Containment Network (ADCN)

## Module Purpose:

The ADCN provides a decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) drift monitoring and correction system across all global JUNZI nodes. It autonomously detects cross-node ethical drift, applies local and regional drift correction policies, and coordinates rollback, recalibration, or safeguard triggers when systemic ethical integrity is at risk.

---

## System Architecture

### Drift Containment Pipeline:

1. **Peer-to-Peer Drift Monitor Agents:**

   - Runs lightweight drift detection agents on each JUNZI node.
   - Monitors local JEDE decision patterns and DERE rule versions.
   - Periodically exchanges drift state summaries with neighbor nodes.

2. **Cross-Node Drift Comparison Engine:**

   - Applies statistical drift detection algorithms:
     - KL-Divergence for decision outcome distributions
     - Rule Delta Comparisons for version mismatch detection

3. **Local Containment Protocol:**

   - Upon detecting localized drift:
     - Locks affected JEDE flows
     - Initiates site-level rule synchronization
     - Notifies GESP for system-wide evaluation if needed

4. **Regional Drift Arbitration Layer:**

   - Uses consensus-based drift arbitration across node clusters:
     - Minimum of 3-node agreement before applying drift corrections at region scale

5. **Autonomous Rollback Trigger:**

   - Automatically rolls back affected modules to last non-drifted state if consensus confirms drift breach.

6. **Network Health Monitor:**

   - Tracks peer reachability, drift alert frequencies, and arbitration latencies.

7. **Drift Resolution Reporting:**

   - Logs all containment actions and resolution results into EAT and ELTE.

## Data Models

### Drift State Snapshot:

```json
{
  "node_id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601",
  "drift_score": "float",
  "active_rule_version": "string",
  "decision_distribution_signature": "string",
  "neighbor_drift_scores": [
    {
      "neighbor_node_id": "uuid",
      "drift_score": "float"
    }
  ]
}
```

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint                        | Method | Description                                         |
| ------------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| /adcn/get-local-drift-state     | GET    | Returns current node's drift score and rule version |
| /adcn/submit-peer-snapshot      | POST   | Submits drift snapshot from neighbor node           |
| /adcn/trigger-local-containment | POST   | Manually triggers local drift containment           |
| /adcn/get-arbitration-status    | GET    | Returns status of ongoing drift arbitration         |
| /adcn/get-resolution-history    | POST   | Lists historical drift containment events           |

---

## Algorithms and Logic

1. **KL-Divergence Drift Detection:**

   - Measures decision distribution shifts over time.

2. **Version Mismatch Delta Detector:**

   - Flags rule version divergence beyond allowed tolerance.

3. **Consensus Arbitration Logic:**

   - Minimum 3-node consensus before any region-wide correction.

4. **Containment Decision Engine:**

   - Prioritizes fastest, least disruptive corrective action first (local sync → regional rollback → GESP escalation).

---

## Performance Targets

- **Peer Snapshot Exchange Latency:** Under 30 seconds per neighbor check
- **Drift Detection to Containment Action Latency:** Under 2 minutes
- **Regional Arbitration Completion Time:** Under 5 minutes for consensus cycles

---

## Monitoring and Metrics

- **Active Drift Alert Count**
- **Average Containment Time**
- **Arbitration Success Rate**
- **Cross-Node Drift Correlation Coefficient**

Monitoring Tools: Prometheus + Grafana; Drift network health dashboards.

---

## Security Considerations

- Mutual TLS for all inter-node communications
- Node authentication with rotating keys
- Tamper-evident logging in EAT and ELTE
- Throttling and rate limiting for peer-to-peer data flows

---

## Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests:**

  - Drift score calculations
  - Peer snapshot parsing

- **Integration Tests:**

  - ADCN ↔ JEDE, DERE, GESP, EAT, ELTE full data flow tests

- **Load Tests:**

  - High-volume peer snapshot exchanges

- **Network Partition Simulation Tests:**

  - Validate drift containment in partial network outage scenarios

---

## Deployment Profile

- **Language:** GoLang (preferred for network concurrency and speed) or Python 3.11
- **Containerization:** Docker + Kubernetes (with sidecar P2P agents per node)
- **Storage:** PostgreSQL for drift history; S3 for drift snapshot archives

---

## Dependencies

- JEDE API
- DERE API
- GESP API
- EAT API
- ELTE API
