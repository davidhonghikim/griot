# JUNZI Phase 4 - Detailed Technical Specification: Regulatory Compliance Adapter (RCA)

## Module Name:

Regulatory Compliance Adapter (RCA)

## Module Purpose:

The RCA enables JUNZI to dynamically adjust ethical decision rules and system behavior based on jurisdiction-specific regulatory frameworks, privacy laws, and legal mandates. It ensures that JUNZI remains compliant with local and international legal requirements across all deployment regions.

---

## System Architecture

### Compliance Adaptation Pipeline:

1. **Jurisdiction Detection Layer:**

   - Determines the applicable legal jurisdiction for each decision based on:
     - User location (GeoIP, GPS, network region)
     - Deployment site configuration
     - Regulatory override tags from system operators

2. **Legal Requirements Loader:**

   - Imports legal constraints and regulatory directives from a centralized Legal Rules Database.
   - Supports dynamic updates for emerging regulations.

3. **Compliance Rule Overlay Engine:**

   - Maps jurisdictional legal constraints to specific rule overrides, exemptions, or enforcement enhancements.
   - Applies overlays on top of existing DERE rule sets at runtime.

4. **Pre-Decision Compliance Checkpoint:**

   - Validates each JEDE decision proposal against the active regulatory overlay.
   - Blocks, modifies, or flags decisions that violate jurisdictional rules.

5. **Compliance Logging Layer:**

   - Records all compliance rule activations, overrides, and blocked decisions.
   - Logs stored in EAT with jurisdiction tags for audit review.

6. **Legal Update Synchronization Service:**

   - Periodically syncs with external legal databases (via API or data feed).
   - Supports GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, and other major frameworks.

## Data Models

### Jurisdiction Mapping Record:

```json
{
  "jurisdiction_id": "uuid",
  "region": "string",
  "country": "string",
  "regulatory_frameworks": ["GDPR", "CCPA", "HIPAA", "CustomLocal"]
}
```

### Compliance Rule Overlay:

```json
{
  "overlay_id": "uuid",
  "jurisdiction_id": "uuid",
  "rule_overrides": [
    {
      "rule_id": "uuid",
      "override_type": "Enforce | Exempt | Modify",
      "modification_details": "JSON"
    }
  ],
  "effective_date": "ISO8601",
  "expiration_date": "ISO8601 (optional)"
}
```

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint                               | Method | Description                                            |
| -------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| /rca/detect-jurisdiction               | POST   | Returns jurisdiction for a given decision context      |
| /rca/get-overlay/{jurisdiction\_id}    | GET    | Retrieves active compliance overlay                    |
| /rca/sync-legal-updates                | POST   | Triggers sync with external legal database             |
| /rca/log-compliance-event              | POST   | Records compliance check outcomes                      |
| /rca/get-compliance-history/{site\_id} | POST   | Retrieves jurisdiction-specific compliance log history |

## Algorithms and Logic

1. **Jurisdiction Resolution Algorithm:**

   - Uses location data and deployment metadata to resolve jurisdiction per decision.

2. **Overlay Application Logic:**

   - Dynamically merges jurisdiction overlays into DERE decision flow.

3. **Compliance Risk Detection:**

   - Flags any decision path that risks regulatory non-compliance based on legal rules.

---

## Performance Targets

- **Jurisdiction Detection Latency:** Under 100ms per decision
- **Overlay Application Latency:** Under 50ms per decision path
- **Legal Sync Update Time:** Under 5 minutes for global rule feed updates

---

## Monitoring and Metrics

- **Compliance Rule Activation Rate**
- **Jurisdiction Detection Accuracy**
- **Blocked Decision Count (per region)**
- **Legal Update Frequency**

---

## Security Considerations

- OAuth 2.0 API security
- Audit logging of all compliance enforcement actions
- External legal data feeds authenticated and integrity-checked
- Data access control for jurisdiction metadata

---

## Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests:**

  - Jurisdiction resolution accuracy
  - Overlay application correctness

- **Integration Tests:**

  - RCA → DERE overlay injection flow
  - RCA → JEDE pre-decision compliance checkpoint

- **Load Tests:**

  - High-frequency decision compliance checking

- **Compliance Drift Tests:**

  - Verify decision path changes post-legal update

---

## Deployment Profile

- **Language:** Python 3.11 or Node.js 18+
- **Containerization:** Docker + Kubernetes
- **Storage:** PostgreSQL for jurisdiction and overlay storage

---

## Dependencies

- DERE API
- JEDE API
- EAT API
- External Legal Database APIs (e.g., GDPR, CCPA registries)
