# JUNZI Phase 3 - Detailed Technical Specification: Ethical Performance Benchmarking Report (EPBR)

## Module Name:
Ethical Performance Benchmarking Report (EPBR)

## Module Purpose:
The EPBR provides quantitative and qualitative measurement frameworks for assessing JUNZI’s ethical decision performance across all pilot sites. It tracks key ethical KPIs, compares performance against baseline expectations, and identifies trends or anomalies for system-wide calibration and governance reporting.

---

## Report Structure

### 1. Executive Benchmark Summary:
- System-wide Ethical Performance Score (EPS)
- Average Decision Latency (ms)
- Overall Stakeholder Satisfaction Index (SSI)
- Ethical Conflict Resolution Rate

### 2. Ethical Decision Quality Metrics:
- Decision Accuracy (compared to human-reviewed gold standards)
- Conflict Detection and Resolution Efficiency
- Consent Compliance Rate
- Ethical Drift Frequency

### 3. Stakeholder Trust Indicators:
- Trust Survey Results Summary (from SFL data)
- Feedback Volume Trends
- Positive vs. Negative Sentiment Ratio

### 4. Risk Management Metrics:
- High-Risk Decision Incidence Rate
- Mitigation Adoption Rate (from RAME logs)
- Post-Mitigation Success Rate

### 5. Ethical Incident Statistics:
- Total Incidents by Severity
- Incident Resolution Time Distribution
- Repeat Incident Rate

### 6. Ethical Drift Metrics:
- Average Ethical Drift Risk Score (EDRS)
- Sites Exceeding Drift Thresholds
- Drift Correction Efficiency (Time to Drift Resolution)

### 7. Benchmark Comparison Tables:
- Current vs. Previous Reporting Period Metrics
- Site-to-Site Ethical Performance Variance
- Module-Level Performance Comparisons (JEDE, DERE, CAM, etc.)

### 8. Recommendations and Corrective Actions:
- Priority Areas for Improvement
- Suggested Rule Adjustments
- Stakeholder Engagement Enhancements

## API Endpoints (Benchmark Generation Engine)

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----|----|----|
| /epbr/generate | POST | Triggers new benchmark report generation |
| /epbr/get-report/{report_id} | GET | Retrieves specific benchmarking report |
| /epbr/export/{report_id} | POST | Exports report in requested format |
| /epbr/get-kpi-summary | GET | Returns latest KPI snapshot across pilot sites |

---

## Data Sources
- JEDE API (for decision metrics)
- DERE API (for rule change history)
- SFL API (for stakeholder satisfaction data)
- EDM API (for drift metrics)
- RAME API (for risk and mitigation data)
- EAT API (for ethical incident logs)

---

## Performance Targets
- **Benchmark Report Generation Time:** Under 3 minutes for system-wide data
- **KPI Summary Query Time:** Under 500ms
- **Historical Comparison Latency:** Under 2 minutes for 12-month data windows

---

## Monitoring and Metrics
- **Report Generation Success Rate**
- **Data Source Availability Rate**
- **Data Freshness Lag**
- **Export Throughput**

---

## Security Considerations
- Role-Based Access Control for report generation and access
- Redaction of sensitive stakeholder details in public exports
- All benchmark generation activities logged in EAT

---

## Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests:**
  - KPI aggregation functions
  - Historical trend calculation accuracy

- **Integration Tests:**
  - Full EPBR → JEDE, DERE, SFL, EDM, RAME, EAT data flow

- **Load Tests:**
  - Simultaneous multi-site benchmark report generation

- **Data Integrity Tests:**
  - Cross-validation of KPI calculations with source module records

---

## Deployment Profile
- **Language:** Python 3.11 (Pandas for analytics) or Node.js 18+ (D3 + custom logic)
- **Containerization:** Docker + Kubernetes
- **Storage:** PostgreSQL for report metadata; S3 or object storage for archived reports

---

## Dependencies
- JEDE API
- DERE API
- SFL API
- EDM API
- RAME API
- EAT API
