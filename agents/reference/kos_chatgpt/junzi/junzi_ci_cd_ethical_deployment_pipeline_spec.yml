# JUNZI CI/CD Ethical Deployment Pipeline Specification

**Node Class:** JunziNode  
**System:** kOS Ecosystem  
**Document Type:** Deployment and Release Governance Specification

---

## Pipeline Objective:
To ensure that all code, models, data pipelines, and configuration changes deployed into JUNZI production environments meet rigorous ethical, technical, and operational standards that align with the HIEROS Code and JUNZI’s nonpartisan integrity mission.

---

## Pipeline Stages:

| Stage | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Stage 1: Code Quality & Unit Tests** | Linting, static analysis, unit testing for all agent and API codebases |
| **Stage 2: Integration Testing** | Validate cross-agent data flows, cross-node communication, and API endpoint reliability |
| **Stage 3: Bias and Fairness Testing** | Run BiasAuditAgent on all AI/ML model outputs for demographic fairness, political neutrality, and false positive rates |
| **Stage 4: Data Provenance Check** | Verify that all ingested datasets and training corpora meet provenance, attribution, and source integrity standards |
| **Stage 5: Ethical Impact Gate** | Manual review by the Ethical Governance Board (EGB) for high-impact model or policy changes |
| **Stage 6: Staging Deployment** | Full deployment into non-production kOS cluster with simulated live data feeds |
| **Stage 7: Drift and Regression Tests** | Compare new system behavior against baseline ethical benchmarks and historical model outputs |
| **Stage 8: Release Readiness Audit** | Final sign-off checklist for API versioning, public documentation updates, and rollback plans |
| **Stage 9: Production Deployment** | Automated blue/green or canary rollout, monitored by kOS orchestration layer and Sentinel agents |
| **Stage 10: Post-Deploy Monitoring** | Real-time observability triggers for latency, anomaly rates, bias drift, and rollback detection |

---

## Required Pre-Deployment Checks:
- ✅ All bias audit metrics pass predefined thresholds
- ✅ No open critical vulnerabilities in dependency tree
- ✅ No pending unresolved disputes affecting release content
- ✅ CI/CD logs archived to VaultNode for immutable audit

---

## Rollback Protocols:
| Trigger Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| Spike in false positives post-deploy | Automatic rollback |
| Bias threshold breach detected by BiasAuditAgent | Deployment freeze + rollback |
| API response error rate exceeds threshold | Rollback + immediate investigation |

---

## Monitoring and Alerting Post-Deployment:
- Real-time Prometheus/Grafana dashboards tracking:
  - Contradiction detection rates
  - Risk scoring drift
  - API uptime
  - Bias audit failure rate
  - User-reported false positive submissions

---

## Governance Integration:
- **Ethical Governance Board (EGB)** signs off on all major model or scoring algorithm changes
- **Bias Monitoring Council** reviews all AI output audit logs pre-release
- **Community Feedback Council** notified for any deployment that affects public-facing entity ratings or profiles

---

**This document now defines the canonical CI/CD Ethical Deployment Pipeline for JUNZI operations within the kOS ecosystem until formally revised.**
