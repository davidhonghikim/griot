# JUNZI Phase 4 - Detailed Technical Specification: Integration and Resilience Infrastructure

## Module Name:
Integration and Resilience Infrastructure (IRI)

## Module Purpose:
The IRI provides the global operational backbone that unifies all Phase 4 JUNZI modules into a cohesive, scalable, and self-healing production environment. It orchestrates multi-region deployments, enforces ethical runtime policies at scale, and embeds failover, disaster recovery, and resilience mechanisms across the entire JUNZI network.

---

## System Architecture

### Core Infrastructure Components:

1. **Global Orchestration Control Plane:**
   - Manages multi-region K8s clusters.
   - Provides a single pane of glass for deployment, scaling, and health monitoring.
   - Tools: Rancher, OpenShift, or Google Anthos.

2. **Service Mesh Layer:**
   - Enables secure, encrypted, and observable inter-service communication globally.
   - Features:
     - mTLS encryption between services
     - Policy-driven traffic control
     - Circuit breaking and rate limiting
   - Recommended: Istio, Linkerd, or Consul Connect.

3. **Distributed Data Replication System:**
   - Ensures consistency across:
     - EAT
     - DERE Rule Repositories
     - Stakeholder Feedback Data
     - Risk Profiles
   - Supports eventual and strong consistency modes per module needs.

4. **Global Disaster Recovery Layer:**
   - Provides automated backup, restoration, and cross-region failover.
   - Recovery Point Objective (RPO): ≤ 5 minutes
   - Recovery Time Objective (RTO): ≤ 15 minutes

5. **Resilience Policy Engine:**
   - Defines failover, retry, and throttling policies for each module.
   - Works with GLOL and AMRE for automated mitigation.

6. **Federated Monitoring Stack:**
   - Unified observability across all regions and modules.
   - Metrics, logs, and tracing from:
     - JEDE
     - DERE
     - SFL
     - EAT
     - GLOL
     - RCA
     - AMRE
     - SVN
   - Tools: Prometheus Federation, Grafana, Loki, Jaeger.

7. **Global Secrets Management:**
   - Centralized key and secret distribution.
   - Geo-redundant secret storage.
   - Recommended: HashiCorp Vault Enterprise or AWS Secrets Manager.

---

## Deployment Topology

- **Region Count:** Minimum 3 global regions (Americas, EMEA, APAC)
- **Cluster Redundancy:** Multi-availability zone per region
- **Traffic Routing:** Latency and health-based global routing via GLOL

---

## API Endpoints (Control Plane)

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----|----|----|
| /iri/deploy-module | POST | Deploys or updates module across target regions |
| /iri/get-cluster-health | GET | Returns live health status of all regions |
| /iri/trigger-failover | POST | Initiates cross-region failover for a module |
| /iri/backup-status | GET | Returns backup and restore status across regions |
| /iri/get-resilience-policy | GET | Retrieves resilience policy definitions |

---

## Performance Targets
- **Cross-Region Failover Time:** Under 15 minutes
- **Backup Consistency Lag:** Under 5 minutes
- **Service Mesh Inter-Service Latency:** < 10ms for intra-region calls; < 100ms inter-region
- **Monitoring Dashboard Refresh Rate:** Under 30 seconds

---

## Monitoring and Metrics
- **Global Service Availability Rate**
- **Failover Success Rate**
- **Backup Success Rate**
- **Data Consistency Drift Rate**
- **Inter-Service Latency Distribution**

---

## Security Considerations
- RBAC and SSO enforcement across the control plane
- Full TLS for all management and service traffic
- Secrets encrypted in transit and at rest
- Federated audit logging (integrated with EAT)

---

## Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Health check logic
  - Failover decision logic

- **Integration Tests:**
  - IRI → GLOL, AMRE, and Dere control flow tests

- **Load Tests:**
  - Multi-region deployment stress tests

- **Disaster Recovery Tests:**
  - Full regional outage simulation

---

## Deployment Profile
- **Platform:** Kubernetes (multi-cluster, multi-region)
- **Management Tools:** Rancher, OpenShift, or Anthos
- **Observability Stack:** Prometheus Federation + Grafana + Loki + Jaeger

---

## Dependencies
- All Phase 4 JUNZI modules (JEDE, DERE, CTI, EAT, SFL, EDM, PAS, RAME, RCA, AMRE, GLOL, SVN)
- CI/CD Pipeline
- External DNS and CDN providers
