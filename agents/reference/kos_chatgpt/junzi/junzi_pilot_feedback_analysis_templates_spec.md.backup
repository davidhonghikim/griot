# JUNZI Phase 3 - Detailed Technical Specification: Pilot Feedback Analysis Report Templates (PFART)

## Module Name:
Pilot Feedback Analysis Report Templates (PFART)

## Module Purpose:
PFART standardizes the structure, content, and format of all pilot site feedback analysis reports during Phase 3. It ensures consistent stakeholder sentiment tracking, ethical performance documentation, issue logging, and decision-making insights across all pilot deployments.

---

## Report Template Structure

### 1. Executive Summary Section:
- Pilot Site Identification
- Reporting Period (Start Date - End Date)
- High-Level Ethical Performance Summary
- Top Stakeholder Sentiment Trends
- Major Ethical Incidents Summary

### 2. Stakeholder Feedback Metrics:
- Total Feedback Items Received
- Feedback Type Distribution:
  - Complaints
  - Suggestions
  - Ethical Concerns
  - Consent Objections
  - General Comments
- Average Stakeholder Satisfaction Score (SSI)
- Stakeholder Response Rate

### 3. Ethical Conflict Analysis:
- Number of Ethical Conflicts Detected
- Conflict Resolution Time Averages
- Top 5 Most Frequent Conflict Types

### 4. Ethical Drift Overview:
- Site’s Ethical Drift Score (EDRS)
- Drift Trendline Graph (Previous 4 Weeks)
- Rule Divergence Summary

### 5. Risk Incident Summary:
- Total Risk Events Logged
- Severity Distribution
- Mitigation Effectiveness Rate

### 6. Rule Adaptation Log:
- Summary of all rule changes made during the reporting period
- Stakeholder-driven rule proposals implemented
- Ethical Drift Recovery Actions

### 7. Consent and Transparency Metrics:
- Number of Consent Requests Triggered
- Consent Grant vs. Denial Ratio
- Average Consent Response Time

### 8. Ethical Incident Response Log:
- Incident Count by Severity

## API Endpoints (Report Generation Engine)

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----|----|----|
| /pfart/generate-report/{site_id} | POST | Creates a new feedback analysis report for a given site and time window |
| /pfart/get-report/{report_id} | GET | Retrieves a specific generated report |
| /pfart/export/{report_id} | POST | Exports report in specified format |
| /pfart/get-metrics-summary/{site_id} | GET | Returns KPI summary for dashboard view |

---

## Data Sources for Report Population:
- SFL (Stakeholder Feedback)
- JEDE (Decision Metrics)
- EDM (Ethical Drift Scores)
- RAME (Risk Incidents)
- CTI (Consent Metrics)
- EAT (Ethical Incident Logs)

---

## Performance Targets
- **Report Generation Time:** Under 2 minutes for standard monthly reports
- **Export Latency:** Under 30 seconds per report
- **Data Freshness Lag:** No more than 5 minutes behind live data for dynamic reports

---

## Monitoring and Metrics (for PFART Engine Health)
- **Report Generation Success Rate**
- **Export Failure Rate**
- **Data Completeness Validation Checks**

---

## Security Considerations
- Role-based report generation and access controls
- Data redaction for PII fields before public export
- All report generation activities logged in EAT

---

## Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Metrics aggregation logic
  - Template rendering

- **Integration Tests:**
  - PFART → SFL, JEDE, EDM, RAME, CTI, EAT data pipelines

- **Load Tests:**
  - Multiple simultaneous report generations

- **Data Consistency Tests:**
  - Cross-check against source module metrics

---

## Deployment Profile
- **Language:** Python 3.11 (Jinja2 for templating) or Node.js 18+ (Handlebars.js or EJS)
- **Containerization:** Docker + Kubernetes
- **Storage:** PostgreSQL for report metadata; S3 or object storage for report files

---

## Dependencies
- SFL API
- JEDE API
- EDM API
- RAME API
- CTI API
- EAT API
