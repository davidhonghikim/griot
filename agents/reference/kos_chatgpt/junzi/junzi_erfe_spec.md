# JUNZI Phase 5 - Detailed Technical Specification: Ethical Risk Forecasting Engine (ERFE)

## Module Name:

Ethical Risk Forecasting Engine (ERFE)

## Module Purpose:

The ERFE delivers predictive ethical risk analysis by forecasting emerging risk hotspots, decision bottlenecks, stakeholder dissatisfaction spikes, and ethical drift zones across the global JUNZI deployment network. It enables preemptive mitigation planning and ethical system resilience enhancement.

---

## System Architecture

### Forecasting Pipeline:

1. **Data Aggregation Layer:**

   - Collects real-time and historical data from:
     - JEDE (decision flow metrics)
     - RAME (risk events)
     - EDM (drift scores)
     - SFL (sentiment and feedback volume)
     - EAT (incident and decision logs)

2. **Feature Engineering Engine:**

   - Generates time series and cross-sectional features such as:
     - Conflict frequency trends
     - Stakeholder satisfaction deltas
     - Drift acceleration metrics
     - Mitigation success rates

3. **Predictive Model Layer:**

   - Supports ensemble forecasting using:
     - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks for sequential risk forecasting
     - Gradient Boosted Trees (e.g., XGBoost) for categorical event risk classification
     - Prophet or ARIMA for seasonal trend risk forecasting

4. **Risk Hotspot Identification Module:**

   - Geospatial and temporal mapping of risk concentration zones (by site, region, stakeholder group).

5. **Early Warning Alert Generator:**

   - Triggers predictive risk alerts sent to:
     - AMRE (for automated mitigations)
     - Governance teams
     - JEDE policy modules

6. **Risk Forecast Dashboard API:**

   - Provides interactive dashboards showing risk forecasts, confidence intervals, and contributing features.

## Algorithms and Models

1. **LSTM-based Time Series Forecasting:**

   - For sequential, near-future risk trajectory predictions.

2. **XGBoost Risk Classification:**

   - For site-level categorical risk tier forecasting.

3. **Prophet or ARIMA Seasonal Models:**

   - For periodic stakeholder satisfaction or drift trend forecasting.

---

## Performance Targets

- **Forecast Generation Time:** Under 10 minutes per global batch
- **Alert Dispatch Latency:** Under 2 minutes post-forecast
- **Forecast Accuracy:** >85% compared to actual outcome ranges

---

## Monitoring and Metrics
