# JUNZI Phase 2 - Detailed Technical Specification: Dynamic Ethical Rule Engine (DERE)

## Module Name:
Dynamic Ethical Rule Engine (DERE)

## Module Purpose:
DERE governs the full lifecycle management of all ethical decision-making rules within the JUNZI system. It enables real-time rule updates, stakeholder-driven rule proposals, automated validation, version control, and controlled deployment pipelines, ensuring that all operational decisions remain ethically current and aligned with stakeholder values.

---

## System Architecture

### High-Level Flow:
1. Rule Creation / Modification
2. Rule Validation
3. Rule Impact Simulation
4. Stakeholder Review and Approval
5. Versioning and Storage
6. Deployment to JEDE Runtime Environment

### Internal Components:
- **Rule Authoring Interface:** REST API + Web-based UI for rule creation.
- **Validation Engine:** Runs syntactic, logical, and ethical constraint checks.
- **Impact Simulator:** Evaluates potential effects of rule changes on historical decision datasets.
- **Version Control Layer:** Tracks rule history, diff logs, and rollback checkpoints.
- **Deployment Controller:** Pushes approved rule sets to JEDE in production and staging environments.
- **Audit Logger:** Captures all changes and stakeholder actions for the Ethical Audit Trail (EAT).

---

## Rule Data Model

### Rule Format:
- YAML or JSON

### Required Fields:
- **rule_id:** Unique identifier (UUID)
- **description:** Human-readable summary
- **priority_weight:** Numeric (0.0 â€“ 1.0)
- **trigger_conditions:** Logical operators with input variable references
- **action_constraints:** Defines permissible or impermissible actions
- **stakeholder_impact_weighting:** Optional per-stakeholder weight modifiers
- **created_by:** Stakeholder or system identifier
- **version:** Auto-incremented

### Optional Metadata:
- Historical performance impact scores
- Previous conflict resolution logs
- Last stakeholder review timestamp

## API Endpoints

- **POST /rules/create**
  - Accepts new rule payload for validation and storage

- **POST /rules/update/{rule_id}**
  - Modifies an existing rule after validation

- **GET /rules/{rule_id}**
  - Retrieves full rule details

- **GET /rules/active**
  - Lists all currently deployed rules

- **POST /rules/simulate-impact**
  - Runs a rule change against historical data for impact analysis

- **POST /rules/deploy**
  - Deploys approved rules to JEDE runtime

- **POST /rules/rollback/{version}**
  - Rolls back to a previous rule set version

---

## Validation Layers

1. **Syntax Validator:** Ensures JSON/YAML schema compliance
2. **Logic Consistency Checker:** Detects circular dependencies or unresolvable conditions
3. **Ethical Constraint Verifier:** Confirms rule alignment with Core Ethical Principles (as defined in Phase 1)
4. **Stakeholder Conflict Detector:** Flags new rules that disproportionately affect stakeholder groups

---

## Deployment Workflow

| Step | Description |
|----|----|
| Rule Proposal | Submitted via API or UI |
| Automated Validation | Run against all validation layers |
| Impact Simulation | Test against past decisions and synthetic scenarios |
| Stakeholder Review | Ethics Council and SFL feedback collected |
| Approval Gate | Final stakeholder sign-off required |
| Production Deployment | Rule pushed live to JEDE |
| Post-Deployment Monitoring | Early impact signals monitored |

---

## Logging and Monitoring

- **Change Logs:** Every rule change stored with user and timestamp metadata
- **Deployment Audit Logs:** Full decision chain for each deployment event
- **Conflict Alerts:** Email and dashboard notification for any detected post-deployment ethical conflicts

---

## Performance Targets
- **Rule Validation Latency:** Under 500ms per rule
- **Simulation Run Time:** <10 minutes for full historical dataset simulation
- **Deployment Time:** <5 seconds for pushing active rule sets to JEDE

---

## Security Considerations
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for rule creation and deployment
- Audit trail immutability (optionally blockchain-backed)
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Multi-factor authentication for deployment approvals

---

## Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests:** Rule parsing, validation logic
- **Integration Tests:** Full JEDE-DERE deployment pipeline
- **Load Tests:** High-volume rule change simulations
- **Edge Case Tests:** Malicious rule submission detection, conflict resolution under extreme conditions

---

## Deployment Profile
- **Runtime:** Python 3.11, Node.js 18+, or Java 17 (configurable)
- **Containerization:** Docker with Kubernetes support
- **Storage:** PostgreSQL or MongoDB for rule storage; optional IPFS integration for distributed environments

---

## Dependencies
- JEDE API for rule deployment
- EAT API for audit logging
- SFL for stakeholder feedback input
- CAM (optional) for context-aware rule simulation
