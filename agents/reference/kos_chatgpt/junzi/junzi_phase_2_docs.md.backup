# JUNZI Phase 2 Detailed Sub-Documents

## Overview
This document contains detailed supporting sub-documents for Phase 2: System Design and Implementation. Each section below corresponds to a critical deliverable or component that was outlined in the Phase 2 Master Plan.

---

## 1. Ethical Decision Engine (JEDE) - Technical Specification

### Purpose:
The JEDE governs real-time ethical decision-making based on the active ethical rule set and contextual inputs.

### Functional Components:
- **Rule Evaluation Engine:** Processes incoming action requests against the Dynamic Ethical Rule Engine (DERE).
- **Contextual Weighting Module:** Assigns situational importance scores.
- **Conflict Resolver:** Handles rule collisions and ethical dilemmas.
- **Audit Output Stream:** Sends decision justification metadata to the Ethical Audit Trail (EAT).

### Data Flow:
1. Input Context →
2. Ethical Rule Matching →
3. Weight Assignment →
4. Decision Resolution →
5. Output Action + Justification

## 2. Values Translation Layer (VTL) - Architecture Blueprint

### Purpose:
Translates high-level ethical policies into machine-executable rules.

### Pipeline Stages:
1. **Policy Ingestion:** NLP-based parsing of stakeholder inputs.
2. **Ethical Context Mapping:** Categorizes inputs by ethical principle.
3. **Rule Generation Engine:** Outputs rule definitions compatible with JEDE.
4. **Validation Sandbox:** Runs generated rules through test scenarios before deployment.

### Key Technologies:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Policy-to-Logic Conversion Algorithms
- Ethics Domain-Specific Ontology (EDSO)

---

## 3. Consent and Transparency Interface (CTI) - UX/UI Guidelines

### Purpose:
Provides end-users with real-time insight into ethical decision logic and captures consent where required.

### UI Components:
- **Decision Explanation Widget:** Visual breakdown of the ethical reasoning pathway.
- **Consent Capture Dialogs:** Stepwise consent requests at ethical checkpoints.
- **Feedback Submission Panel:** Allows users to submit approval, objections, or comments.

### Accessibility Features:
- WCAG-compliant design
- Multilingual support
- Text-to-Speech explanations for visually impaired users

---

## 4. Dynamic Ethical Rule Engine (DERE) - Rule Management Protocol

### Purpose:
Manages the full lifecycle of ethical rules.

### Core Features:
- **Rule Creation API:** For stakeholder-driven rule input.
- **Rule Version Control:** Track changes, with rollback capability.
- **Impact Simulation Module:** Test rule changes against historical decision data.
- **Deployment Pipeline:** Controlled release with stakeholder review gates.

---

## 5. Ethical Audit Trail (EAT) - Data Structure Specification

### Purpose:
Ensures tamper-proof logging of all ethical decision points.

### Data Schema:
- **Timestamp**
- **Decision ID**
- **Input Context Snapshot**
- **Rule Set Version**
- **Decision Outcome**
- **Justification Summary**
- **Stakeholder Consent State**

### Optional Enhancements:
- Blockchain-backed immutability for high-trust environments.
- Public API for third-party auditors.

---

## 6. Stakeholder Feedback Loop (SFL) - Engagement Process Design

### Purpose:
Channels structured stakeholder input back into system calibration.

### Engagement Channels:
- Online Portals
- Scheduled Surveys
- Stakeholder Forums
- Anonymous Feedback Mechanisms

### Analysis Pipeline:
1. Feedback Ingestion
2. Categorization and Sentiment Scoring
3. Priority Assignment
4. Feedback-Driven Rule Proposal Generation

---

## 7. Contextual Awareness Module (CAM) - Sensor Integration Plan

### Purpose:
Collects and processes environmental, user-specific, and operational context data for JEDE decisioning.

### Data Sources:
- API Feeds
- Environmental Sensors (where applicable)
- User Profile Contexts
- External System Signals

### Processing Layers:
- **Normalization Engine:** Converts heterogeneous data to standard formats.
- **Context Scoring Model:** Rates relevance and urgency of incoming data streams.

---

## 8. Policy and Action Simulator (PAS) - Testing Environment Design

### Purpose:
Simulates proposed system actions in virtual ethical test scenarios.

### Core Features:
- **Scenario Generator:** Builds synthetic test cases.
- **Outcome Evaluator:** Analyzes policy decisions against ethical KPIs.
- **Stress Test Mode:** Runs high-frequency decision bursts for load testing ethical logic under pressure.

---

## 9. Risk Assessment and Mitigation Engine (RAME) - Risk Framework Design

### Purpose:
Proactively evaluates ethical risk and recommends pre-action mitigations.

### Functional Components:
- **Risk Scoring Algorithms:** Weigh potential harms.
- **Mitigation Recommendation Engine:** Suggests actionable adjustments.
- **Post-Action Risk Analysis:** Logs outcome-based risk deltas for ongoing learning.

---

## Next Steps for Phase 2 Implementation
1. Finalize technical documentation for each module.
2. Conduct internal design reviews and stakeholder validation cycles.
3. Begin parallelized module development sprints.
4. Prepare for integrated system testing as defined in the Phase 2 Master Plan.
