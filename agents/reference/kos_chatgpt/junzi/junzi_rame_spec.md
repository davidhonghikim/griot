# JUNZI Phase 2 - Detailed Technical Specification: Risk Assessment and Mitigation Engine (RAME)

## Module Name:

Risk Assessment and Mitigation Engine (RAME)

## Module Purpose:

RAME provides real-time and pre-action ethical risk analysis for all proposed actions, policies, and rule changes within JUNZI. It calculates ethical risk scores, recommends mitigation strategies, and continuously learns from post-action outcomes to refine future risk predictions.

---

## System Architecture

### Risk Evaluation Pipeline:

1. **Risk Input Aggregation Layer:**

   - Collects inputs from:
     - JEDE (decision proposals)
     - DERE (rule changes)
     - PAS (simulation outcomes)
     - CAM (contextual anomalies)
     - SFL (high-priority stakeholder feedback)

2. **Preprocessing Layer:**

   - Normalizes input formats
   - Extracts relevant ethical and contextual variables

3. **Risk Scoring Engine:**

   - Uses hybrid risk models:
     - Rule-Based Ethical Risk Estimation
     - Bayesian Risk Scoring (for probabilistic risk)
     - Machine Learning Risk Predictor (Gradient Boosting or Random Forest classifier trained on historical EAT data)

4. **Mitigation Recommendation Engine:**

   - Maps calculated risks to predefined mitigation strategies.
   - Suggests alternative actions, consent rechecks, or rule adjustments.

5. **Post-Decision Risk Auditing Layer:**

   - Compares predicted risk with actual post-action ethical impact (based on EAT logs).
   - Updates ML models for future recalibration.

6. **Threshold Trigger Layer:**

   - Automatically halts or flags actions exceeding predefined ethical risk thresholds.
   - Escalates high-risk items for human Ethics Council review.

## Algorithms and Risk Models

1. **Bayesian Risk Scoring:**

   - Calculates probability of negative ethical impact based on prior occurrence rates in similar contexts.

2. **ML Risk Predictor:**

   - Inputs:
     - Contextual variables
     - Rule set features
     - Stakeholder impact profiles
   - Outputs:
     - Ethical Risk Probability
     - Top Contributing Features

3. **Rule-Based Scoring Heuristics:**

   - Uses fixed risk weights for known high-risk ethical triggers (e.g., consent bypass, stakeholder exclusion).

---

## Performance Targets

- **Risk Assessment Latency:** Under 300ms per standard decision
- **Throughput:** 5,000+ assessments per minute (scalable)
- **Post-Action Audit Delay:** Under 5 minutes for ML model retraining batches

---

## Monitoring and Metrics

- **Average Risk Score Distribution**
- **High-Risk Detection Rate**
- **Mitigation Adoption Rate**
- **False Positive/Negative Risk Rates**

Monitoring Tools: Prometheus + Grafana with risk-specific dashboard modules.

---

## Security Considerations

- Role-Based Access Control for risk override functions
- Input validation for all API calls
- Audit logging of all risk assessments (via EAT)
- Encryption of risk model training datasets

---

## Testing Requirements
