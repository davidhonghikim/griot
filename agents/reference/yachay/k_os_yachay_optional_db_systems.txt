# kOS Yachay - Optional and Recommended Database Systems

Node Class: **Yachay (Memory Starseed)**

---

## ✅ Recommended Additional Database Targets for Yachay (Beyond MongoDB, Neo4j, Weaviate)

| DB System | Type | Best Use Cases in Yachay | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PostgreSQL** | Relational / SQL | Task tracking, agent sessions, structured logs, metrics | Works well with TimescaleDB for time-series data |
| **ChromaDB** | VectorDB (embedded or server) | Lightweight local vector storage for dev/test, RAG prototyping | Easy for single-node dev, can scale horizontally with effort |
| **Milvus** | VectorDB (Cloud-scale) | High-throughput, high-volume vector search (millions of docs) | Heavyweight, production-grade VectorDB |
| **RedisJSON / RedisGraph** | In-memory + JSON store | Fast caching for prompt contexts, temp storage | Not durable for long-term memory |
| **ElasticSearch** | Full-text + Vector (with plugins) | Hybrid full-text and vector similarity | Requires more ops overhead |
| **TimescaleDB (on top of Postgres)** | Time-series | Metrics, logs, performance tracking, event timelines | Native SQL interface |
| **Pinecone** | Managed VectorDB | Fully hosted, easy RAG integration | External SaaS, $$$ |
| **Zilliz Cloud** | Managed Milvus | Hosted Milvus alternative | External, less control |

## ✅ Yachay Design Principle:
"**Pluggable Knowledge Backend**"

You should be able to swap or run multiple DB types in parallel without breaking Yachay agent workflows.

---

## ✅ Deployment Pattern Recommendation:

| Layer | Recommended DB |
|---|---|
| **Structured Data (Tasks, Metrics, Config)** | PostgreSQL |
| **Documents / Personas / Sessions** | MongoDB |
| **Graph Relationships (Agent Links, Persona Graphs)** | Neo4j |
| **Semantic Vector Memory (RAG, Context Retrieval)** | Weaviate / Chroma / Milvus / ElasticSearch (choose based on scale) |
| **Cache / Temp State** | Redis |
| **Logs + Time-Series** | TimescaleDB |

---

## ✅ Optional Next Steps:
- Generate Helm charts for Postgres, ChromaDB, Milvus, Redis
- Build a unified "Yachay Knowledge Store Config" allowing runtime selection of DB backends
- Build DB migration scripts (Mongo → Postgres → Vector chunks)
