# kOS Observation Node Class Specification

## Overview
The **kOS Observation Node Class** specializes in focused, high-resolution monitoring, real-time data visualization, and continuous state assessment of specific targets within the kOS ecosystem. Unlike Discovery Nodes, which broadly sense for new signals, Observation Nodes maintain persistent, targeted watch over known systems, entities, or environmental parameters.

Observation Nodes act as the ecosystem's "watchtowers," providing deep visibility and behavioral analytics on monitored subjects.

---

## 1. Primary Roles and Functions

- Targeted system, agent, or environmental state observation
- High-frequency telemetry capture
- Behavioral trend analysis
- Temporal state comparison and historical baseline tracking
- Event correlation and anomaly flagging for ongoing subjects
- Data enrichment for Knowledge Graph and Skald narratives

---

## 2. Target Types for Observation

- Specific agents or agent groups
- Individual nodes or node clusters
- External systems or API endpoints
- Environmental variables (temperature, traffic, user activity, etc.)
- User behavior patterns

---

## 3. Standard Agent Types within Observation Nodes

- **Behavioral Analytics Agents**
- **Trend Monitoring Agents**
- **Anomaly Scoring Agents**
- **State Change Detectors**
- **GEIG Compliance Monitors**

---

## 4. Internal Architecture

### 4.1 Persistent Target Registry
- Maintains active watch lists
- Supports dynamic target onboarding and offboarding

### 4.2 Real-Time Monitoring Layer
- Low-latency data sampling
- Rolling time-window aggregators
- Optional adaptive sampling for high-load scenarios

### 4.3 Contextual Analysis Layer
- Compares current state vs historical baselines
- Calculates deviation scores
- Correlates observed behaviors with Knowledge Graph data

---

## 5. Ethical and Security Considerations

- GEIG-enforced observation rules
- No observation of private user data without consent
- Transparency flags for monitored users (where required)
- Rate-limiting for resource-intensive observation tasks

---

## 6. Output Routing

- Real-time feed to Data Fabric and Knowledge Graph
- Event triggers to GCTE for threshold breaches
- Optional direct handoff to Skald modules for narrative generation
- Export to external monitoring tools (optional and configurable)

---

## 7. Performance and Scaling

- Parallel target monitoring threads
- Sharded observation pipelines for large watchlists
- Elastic resource allocation during observation bursts
- Support for both short-term tactical and long-term strategic observation tasks

---

## 8. Visualization and Reporting

- Observation dashboards with live target metrics
- Behavioral trend visualizers
- Deviation heatmaps
- Alert thresholds and notification rules

---

## 9. Advanced Features

- AI-assisted anomaly detection for long-tail behavioral deviations
- Predictive behavioral modeling
- Cross-target event correlation
- Smart observation focus shifting based on ecosystem-wide priorities

---

## Conclusion
The **kOS Observation Node Class** provides continuous, targeted insight into the state and behavior of critical ecosystem elementsâ€”enabling proactive response, ethical oversight, and informed decision-making across the kOS network.
