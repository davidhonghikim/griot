# kOS Security and Zero Trust Layer

## Overview
The **kOS Security and Zero Trust Layer (SZTL)** defines the multi-tiered security framework that governs authentication, authorization, data integrity, encryption, and trust boundaries across the entire kOS ecosystem. Rooted in a Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), the layer ensures that no node, agent, user, or external system is implicitly trusted at any time.

## Core Security Principles

| Principle                  | Description                                        |
|------------------------- |------------------------------------------------ |
| Zero Trust by Default      | No implicit trust between nodes, agents, or users |
| Principle of Least Privilege | Agents and modules receive the minimum permissions necessary |
| Defense-in-Depth           | Multiple layers of security controls               |
| Continuous Verification    | Revalidate identity, trust, and permissions continuously |
| Ethical Safeguards         | JUNZI-layer integration for ethical policy enforcement at the security level |

---

## Authentication Framework

| Mechanism                 | Purpose                                      |
|------------------------ |------------------------------------------ |
| Mutual TLS               | Secure agent-to-agent and node-to-node communication |
| Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) | Node identity validation                      |
| OAuth2 / OIDC (Optional) | For external API user authentication       |
| Agent API Key Rotation    | Regular key refresh for all agents         |
| Biometric / MFA Support   | Optional for human user access             |

---

## Authorization Model

| Model                     | Description                                   |
|------------------------ |----------------------------------------- |
| Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) | Define agent, user, and system roles with strict permission scopes |
| Node Class Boundaries      | Node Class-specific operational limits        |
| Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) | Optional, for fine-grained policy enforcement |
| Ethics-Gated Authorization | JUNZI pre-screening for high-risk operations  |

---

## Encryption Standards

| Layer                     | Encryption Type                          |
|------------------------ |------------------------------------ |
| Data-at-Rest             | AES-256 or stronger                    |
| Data-in-Transit          | TLS 1.3 or higher                      |
| Agent-to-Agent Messaging | Optional message-level encryption (gRPC with mTLS or custom) |
| Storage Backends          | Encrypted volumes for databases and logs |

---

## Threat Detection and Intrusion Prevention

| Component                 | Function                                |
|------------------------ |------------------------------------ |
| Behavioral Anomaly Detection | Flag unusual agent or node activity     |
| Ethics Violation Monitor  | Quarantine nodes with repeated ethical breaches |
| Rate Limiting and Throttling | Prevent DoS-style overload attacks      |
| Network Traffic Analysis  | Monitor for suspicious network behavior  |
| Audit Trail Tamper Detection | Cryptographic verification of audit log integrity |

---

## Agent-Level Security Controls

| Control                  | Description                             |
|---------------------- |------------------------------------- |
| Sandbox Isolation        | Run skills in restricted environments |
| Resource Quotas          | Enforce per-agent CPU, memory, and bandwidth limits |
| Execution Whitelisting   | Allow only approved skills and binaries |
| Outbound Call Filtering  | Prevent unauthorized external network access |

---

## Data Integrity and Validation

| Mechanism                | Purpose                                  |
|----------------------- |------------------------------------ |
| Checksum Verification    | Validate skill packages and agent binaries |
| Digital Signatures       | Ensure provenance and authenticity       |
| Immutable Audit Trails   | Prevent retroactive log tampering        |
| Ethics-Tagged Data Streams | Mark all sensitive data with ethical classification tags |

---

## Security Monitoring and Metrics

| Metric                  | Purpose                                  |
|--------------------- |------------------------------------ |
| Failed Auth Attempts    | Detect brute-force or credential stuffing |
| Ethics Violation Frequency | Highlight compromised agents          |
| Resource Abuse Patterns | Detect compromised or malfunctioning nodes |
| Message Anomaly Rate    | Flag unusual traffic spikes or payload sizes |

---

## Response and Recovery

| Incident Type          | System Response                          |
|-------------------- |------------------------------------- |
| Auth Breach            | Immediate credential rotation and agent suspension |
| Ethics Escalation       | Quarantine, ethics review, potential node lockdown |
| DoS Attempt             | Rate limit, firewall, and traffic filtering activation |
| Data Integrity Breach   | Rollback to last verified backup and trigger system-wide audit |

---

## Developer Requirements

| Requirement              | Mandatory For...                          |
|---------------------- |-------------------------------------- |
| Security Review Checklist | All new modules and agents             |
| Threat Model Documentation | Any major subsystem update             |
