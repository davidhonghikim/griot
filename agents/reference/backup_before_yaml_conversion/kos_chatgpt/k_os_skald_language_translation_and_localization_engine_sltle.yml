# kOS Skald Language Translation and Localization Engine (SLTLE)

## Overview
The **kOS Skald Language Translation and Localization Engine (SLTLE)** provides dynamic, context-aware, and ethically filtered language translation and localization services for all Skald-generated messages across the kOS ecosystem.

SLTLE ensures that every communication—whether human-readable, machine-to-machine, or multi-modal—is delivered in the recipient's preferred language, dialect, and culturally appropriate format, while maintaining GEIG ethical constraints.

---

## 1. Core Responsibilities

- Multi-language translation
- Cultural and regional localization
- Terminology consistency
- Sentiment preservation across languages
- Ethical language moderation

---

## 2. Supported Input Types

- Raw text strings
- Markdown-formatted content
- JSON-based message payloads
- HTML fragments for UI rendering
- Agent-to-agent system messages (structured schemas)

---

## 3. Translation Pipeline

### 3.1 Source Identification
- Detects source language (auto-detect or explicit)
- Classifies message intent and target audience

### 3.2 Pre-Processing Filters
- Cleans and normalizes source text
- Applies sensitive content masking if flagged by GEIG
- Contextual metadata tagging (urgency, tone, audience level)

### 3.3 Translation Engine Layer
- Supports pluggable translation backends:
  - Open-source translation models (MarianMT, OpenNMT)
  - Proprietary LLM integrations (Optional)
  - Rule-based language packs for niche or low-resource languages
- Maintains terminology consistency using system glossaries

### 3.4 Localization Processor
- Adjusts:
  - Date/time formats
  - Units of measurement
  - Cultural references
  - Formality levels (Casual, Neutral, Formal)

### 3.5 Post-Processing and Validation
- Runs sentiment and tone consistency checks
- Optional human-in-the-loop review for sensitive messages
- GEIG ethical compliance check on final output
