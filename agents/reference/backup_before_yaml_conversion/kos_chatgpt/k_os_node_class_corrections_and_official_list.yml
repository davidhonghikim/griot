## ✅ Notes:
- All future documents, modules, and specs will use this **canonical Node Class list only**.
- This supersedes all prior drafts that used placeholder or non-cultural names.
- Node Class responsibilities and metaphors are tightly linked to **cultural, biological, and system roles** as defined in the Node Specifications Index and detailed class documents.

---

## ✅ Next Steps:
- Regenerate the "Agent Node Class Specification" doc using this corrected canonical list.
- Audit and fix all existing documents that referenced incorrect or placeholder node class names.
