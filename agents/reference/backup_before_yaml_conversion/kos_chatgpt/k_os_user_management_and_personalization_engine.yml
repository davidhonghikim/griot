# kOS User Management and Personalization Engine

## Overview
The **kOS User Management and Personalization Engine (UMPE)** governs how users are represented, authenticated, managed, and served personalized experiences across the kOS ecosystem. It handles user identity, profile storage, privacy controls, consent management, and context-aware personalization for all agent and node interactions.
