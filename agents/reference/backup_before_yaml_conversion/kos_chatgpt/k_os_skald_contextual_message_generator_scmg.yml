# kOS Skald Contextual Message Generator (SCMG)

## Overview
The **kOS Skald Contextual Message Generator (SCMG)** is the primary content generation engine within the Skald Class. It is responsible for dynamically creating context-aware, audience-tailored messages, responses, alerts, and narrative content across the kOS ecosystem.

SCMG translates structured trigger events from the GCTE into human-readable, machine-consumable, or multi-format outputs based on predefined templates, learned patterns, or AI-assisted composition.

---

## 1. Functional Role within Skald

- Converts GCTE triggers into actionable messages.
- Applies audience targeting parameters.
- Supports multi-modal content outputs (text, speech, API payloads).
- Interfaces with translation, summarization, and formatting modules downstream.

---

## 2. Input Sources

- GCTE Trigger Payloads
- Agent task outputs
- Knowledge Graph insights
- User profile preferences
- External API data (if allowed by GEIG)

---

## 3. Content Generation Layers

### 3.1 Template Engine
- Supports Markdown, HTML, JSON, and plaintext templates.
- Dynamic variable substitution from trigger payloads and context enrichments.
- Includes default system templates for common alerts, system messages, and notifications.

### 3.2 AI Language Model Integration (Optional)
- LLM plugin integration for free-form or adaptive message generation.
- Contextual constraint enforcement to maintain factuality and alignment with GEIG ethical parameters.
- Supports fine-tuned models for domain-specific communications.

### 3.3 Summarization and Condensation Layer
- Auto-generates concise summaries for long payloads.
- Multi-level verbosity controls (Brief, Standard, Detailed).

---

## 4. Audience Targeting Module

- Customizes messages based on:
  - Recipient type (User, Agent, Node, External System)
  - Role sensitivity (Admin, Public, Restricted)
  - Preferred language or data format
  - Delivery channel (UI, Email, SMS, API callback, WebSocket, etc.)

---

## 5. API Endpoints

- `/scmg/message/generate`
- `/scmg/template/list`
- `/scmg/template/update`
- `/scmg/message/preview`
- `/scmg/message/dispatch`

---

## 6. Ethical and Security Filters

- Pre-generation GEIG ethical check on message content and delivery target.
- Rate-limiting for high-frequency notification types.
- Sensitive content redaction or modification before dispatch.
- Full logging of generated message history.

---

## 7. Multi-Modal Output Support

- Text (Markdown, HTML, Plaintext)
- Audio (via TTS engines, optional)
- JSON payloads for API consumption
- Graphical or tabular embeds for UI presentation

---

## 8. Performance and Scaling

- Stateless API model for high parallelism
- Caching of frequently generated standard messages
- Batched generation support for bulk notifications

---

## 9. Advanced Features

- Sentiment and tone adjustment based on recipient context
- Support for multilingual output (via downstream Skald Translation Layer)
- Personalization hooks for user-preference-driven messaging
- A/B testing framework for optimizing notification styles

---

## Conclusion
The **kOS Skald Contextual Message Generator (SCMG)** serves as the creative voice and messaging engine of the Skald Classâ€”transforming raw triggers into ethically safe, audience-specific, and context-aware messages for users, agents, and external systems across the kOS ecosystem.
