# Phase 8: Module Specification Index (Starting Point for Next Chat)

## Purpose
This document serves as the definitive index for Phase 8 of the kOS buildout: **Module-Level Specification Phase**. This will be the starting checkpoint for detailed low-level module specifications, starting with GEIG (Global Ethical Interoperability Gateway).

## Scope
Phase 8 covers all module-level design specifications for the kOS ecosystem. Each module spec will follow the required engineering style: detailed, low-level, implementation-ready, and formatted in Markdown for export and review.

## Specification Order (Phase 8 Modules)

1. **GEIG (Global Ethical Interoperability Gateway)**
   - Ethical interoperability filter
   - Cross-agent communication mediation
   - Bias detection and mitigation layer

2. **DERE (Dynamic Entity Runtime Engine)**
   - Handles dynamic agent and node execution
   - Runtime lifecycle orchestration
   - Resource allocation

3. **NIMBUS (Node Initialization and Management Bus)**
   - Node bootstrapper
   - Auto-scaling and node health monitoring

4. **ARC (Adaptive Resource Controller)**
   - Load balancing
   - Resource utilization manager

5. **FRACTAL (Federated Resource and Contextual Task Allocation Layer)**
   - Federated orchestration
   - Multi-node task splitting and recombination

6. **SKALD (Semantic Knowledge and Linguistic Dispatcher)**
   - Storyteller and narrative engine
   - Universal language and format handler

7. **OMNI (Operational Metrics and Node Intelligence)**
   - Telemetry
   - Node behavior analysis

8. **VESPER (Verification, Escalation, and Protection Event Router)**
   - Security event processing
   - Escalation workflows

9. **GAL (Global Awareness Layer)**
   - Global state awareness
   - Distributed situational intelligence

10. **SYNDICATE (Systemic Yield and Node Deployment Control Engine)**
    - Yield optimization
   - Deployment scheduler

## Next Step
We will begin with **Module 1: GEIG (Global Ethical Interoperability Gateway)** in the next conversation.
