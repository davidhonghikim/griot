# kOS Deployment Topologies and Node Scaling

## Overview
The **kOS Deployment Topologies and Node Scaling** specification defines supported deployment models, scaling patterns, and infrastructure configurations for nodes and agents within the kOS ecosystem. It provides engineering guidance for deploying kOS across diverse environments—ranging from single-node offline setups to global, federated, multi-node networks.

---

## Supported Deployment Topologies

| Topology Type          | Description                                  |
|--------------------- |----------------------------------------- |
| Single Node (Offline Mode) | Standalone deployment on a single device with no external connectivity |
| Local Mesh Network    | Peer-to-peer deployment across nearby devices using LoRa, WiFi Direct, or local network |
| Private Cluster       | Multi-node deployment within a private data center or enterprise network |
| Public Cloud Deployment | Hosted deployment on cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.) |
| Federated Multi-Region | Geographically distributed clusters synchronized over secure channels |
| Hybrid Topology        | Combination of any of the above (e.g., cloud orchestrator + local edge nodes) |

---

## Node Scaling Strategies

| Scaling Model         | Description                                  |
|-------------------- |----------------------------------------- |
| Vertical Scaling      | Increase CPU, memory, or storage resources per node |
| Horizontal Scaling    | Deploy more nodes of the same Node Class to handle load |
| Dynamic Scaling       | Auto-scale nodes and agents based on load, trigger events, or scheduled policies |
| Manual Scaling        | Operator-driven scaling via deployment CLI or API |

---

## Load Distribution Patterns

| Pattern              | Use Case                                     |
|------------------- |------------------------------------------ |
| Round Robin         | Even task distribution across nodes        |
| Resource-Aware      | Prefer nodes with available resources      |
| Node Class-Aware    | Route tasks based on Node Class specialization |
| Ethics-Weighted     | Factor ethical standing and violation history into scheduling decisions |
| Geographical Proximity | Prioritize local nodes for low-latency operations |

---

## High Availability (HA) Configurations

| Component             | HA Strategy                                  |
|-------------------- |----------------------------------------- |
| Orchestrator Layer    | Active/Passive or Active/Active failover     |
| Communication Bus     | Multi-path routing with redundancy          |
| Data Persistence Layer | Multi-zone or multi-region database replication |
| Agent Deployment      | Warm standby agents for critical roles      |
| Ethics Filter Layer   | Distributed JUNZI filters with fallback nodes |

---

## Deployment Tools and Orchestration Support

| Tool/Platform         | Purpose                                      |
|-------------------- |----------------------------------------- |
| Docker / OCI Containers | Package agents and microservices           |
| Kubernetes / K3s      | Cluster-level orchestration and scaling     |
| Ansible / Terraform   | Infrastructure as Code for reproducible deployments |
| Helm Charts           | Simplified multi-service deployments       |
| Custom kOS CLI        | Node provisioning, agent deployment, monitoring |

---

## Network Considerations

| Factor                | Engineering Guidance                        |
|-------------------- |----------------------------------------- |
| Bandwidth Variability | Optimize for low-bandwidth or offline scenarios (Nomad Node Class prioritization) |
| Latency Sensitivity   | Deploy latency-critical agents closer to users |
| Mesh vs Star Topology | Use mesh for decentralized resilience; use star for centralized orchestration |
| Edge vs Cloud Deployment | Match node class roles with appropriate network layer (e.g., Skald nodes at edge, Archon nodes at core) |

## Scaling by Node Class

| Node Class         | Typical Scaling Strategy                  |
|----------------- |-------------------------------------- |
| Griot             | Replicated for redundancy and knowledge distribution |
| Tohunga           | Deployed close to sensor-rich environments |
| Ronin             | Horizontally scalable for distributed discovery |
| Musa              | Clustered for security-critical zones      |
| Hakim             | On-demand scaling for load spikes in diagnostics |
| Skald             | Edge-deployed for low-latency communication tasks |
| Oracle            | Centralized or regional hubs for data-heavy forecasting |
| Junzi             | Singleton or small cluster with high integrity guarantee |
| Yachay            | Centralized for long-term state persistence |
| Sachem            | Clustered for decision consensus mechanisms |
| Archon            | Centralized for orchestration control      |
| Amauta            | Replicated at training and educational hubs |
| Mzee              | Distributed across the system for emergent self-awareness |

## Monitoring and Autoscaling Triggers

| Metric                | Autoscaling Behavior                      |
|------------------- |------------------------------------ |
| CPU Utilization       | Launch new nodes when CPU exceeds threshold |
| Memory Pressure       | Scale vertically or horizontally based on memory saturation |
| Queue Backlogs        | Add agents or nodes to clear task queues |
| Ethics Violation Rate | Throttle risky agents, scale trusted nodes |
| User Load Increase    | Expand edge nodes to meet demand        |

## Disaster Recovery and Failover

| Failure Scenario      | Recommended Response                    |
|------------------- |----------------------------------- |
| Node Crash           | Auto-respawn agents on healthy nodes |
| Data Loss             | Restore from replicated backups     |
| Ethics Layer Outage   | Pause all high-risk operations     |
| Network Partition     | Local autonomy with deferred synchronization |

## Extensibility and Future Work

- AI-driven dynamic topology optimization
- User-configurable deployment blueprints
- Federated learning-aware node scaling
- Integration with decentralized resource marketplaces (Tokidao layer)

The **kOS Deployment Topologies and Node Scaling** specification ensures that kOS can deploy, scale, and recover across any environment—from single offline devices to planetary-scale distributed systems—while respecting Node Class roles and ethical operational limits.
