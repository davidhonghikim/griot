# JUNZI Cross-Node Interaction Flow

**Purpose:** This document defines how JUNZI (JunziNode) interacts with other kOS Node Classes during typical lifecycle operations like data ingestion, analysis, narrative reporting, risk scoring, and public alerting.

---

## Primary Nodes in JUNZI's Cross-Node Workflow:

| Node Class     | Role in JUNZI Operations                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GriotNode**  | Builds narrative timelines of ethical behavior, contradiction histories, and public integrity records for entities. Consumes structured outputs from JUNZI and converts them into human-readable timelines or reports. |
| **OracleNode** | Provides predictive analysis on future ethical risk and behavioral drift patterns based on historical data and live event streams from JUNZI.                                                                          |
| **YachayNode** | Acts as the long-term memory layer, archiving all processed contradiction reports, risk scores, and jurisdictional profiles from JUNZI.                                                                                |
| **MusaNode**   | Executes protective responses or triggers external security systems if a high-severity ethical violation escalates to needing active intervention or containment.                                                      |

## Cross-Node Event Flow: JUNZI-Centric Lifecycle

### ðŸ“¥ 1. **Data Ingestion Phase:**

- **Source Nodes:** Observer pipelines, external API listeners, user reports.
- **JUNZI Action:** ContradictionScannerAgent & RiskProfilerAgent parse incoming entity actions, public statements, financials, and behaviors.

### ðŸ§  2. **Integrity Processing Phase:**

- **Within JUNZI Node:**
  - Contradiction Detection
  - Risk Scoring
  - Bias Auditing
  - Jurisdictional Context Classification

### ðŸ“¨ 3. **Downstream Node Handoff:**

| Target Node    | Data Passed                                                                                                                       |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GriotNode**  | Fully scored contradiction timelines, risk rating histories, and behavior-change event streams.                                   |
| **OracleNode** | Pattern datasets on contradictions, behavioral volatility metrics, jurisdictional violation frequency for risk projection models. |
| **YachayNode** | All finalized contradiction reports, risk score logs, and source-provenance datasets for permanent archiving.                     |
| **MusaNode**   | High-severity ethical breach alerts with escalation level metadata for possible containment or defense triggers.                  |

### ðŸ“¢ 4. **Public Alerting Phase:**

- **From JUNZI Node:**
  - Exposed via Public API `/junzi/api/v1/alerts/`
  - Sourced directly from the PublicExposureAgent within JUNZI.
  - Distributed via CommunicatorNode if global broadcast needed.

### ðŸª¢ 5. **Feedback Loop Phase:**

- **User feedback, media reports, and whistleblower tips** flow back into JUNZI via Public API POST `/user_reports/`
- **JUNZI â†’ YachayNode â†’ OracleNode**: For updated risk modeling and historical trend alignment.

## Event Logging & Traceability:

- All cross-node handoffs log event signatures in the kOS VaultNode for data integrity and compliance.
