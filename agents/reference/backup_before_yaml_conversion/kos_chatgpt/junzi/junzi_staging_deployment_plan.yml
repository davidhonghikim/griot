# JUNZI Staging Deployment Plan

**Node Class:** JunziNode  
**System:** kOS Ecosystem  
**Document Type:** Pre-Production Environment Deployment Strategy

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose:
To define the step-by-step process for deploying JUNZI into a fully functional staging environment for QA, load testing, integration testing, and stakeholder review.

---

## âœ… Staging Environment Configuration:

| Component | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Backend API** | FastAPI with Gunicorn + Uvicorn Workers |
| **Frontend** | Next.js SSR or Static Export (staging mode) |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL (staging instance) |
| **Load Balancer** | NGINX or Traefik with HTTPS termination |
| **Secrets Management** | `.env.staging` file OR Kubernetes Secrets OR VaultNode |
| **Monitoring** | Prometheus + Grafana with staging-specific dashboards |
| **Logging** | Loki / ELK with staging-specific index |

---

## âœ… Deployment Steps:

1. âœ… **Infrastructure Prep:**
   - Provision staging servers or cloud instances
   - Configure VPC / networking rules

2. âœ… **Database Migration:**
   - Run Alembic migrations for schema setup
   - Seed with synthetic test data (Test Seeder Script)

3. âœ… **Build & Deploy:**
   - Build backend and frontend Docker images
   - Push to staging registry
   - Apply staging Kubernetes manifests OR start Docker Compose services

4. âœ… **Environment Variables:**
   - Load `.env.staging` with staging-specific config
   - Include non-production API keys and DB credentials

5. âœ… **Agent Activation:**
   - Start all core JUNZI agents with `--mode staging`
   - Enable verbose logging for diagnostics

6. âœ… **Health Check & Smoke Tests:**
   - Run predefined smoke tests on API endpoints
   - Verify frontend routing and page loads
   - Validate agent-to-database connectivity

7. âœ… **Monitoring Hook-Up:**
   - Verify Prometheus metrics scraping
   - Deploy Grafana dashboard with staging tag filters

8. âœ… **Run Load and Integration Tests:**
   - Execute Load Test Scripts (Locust, k6)
   - Run E2E Test Suite against staging environment

9. âœ… **Stakeholder Access:**
   - Enable restricted external access for QA, PMs, and selected partners
   - Protect with Basic Auth or API Key gate if needed

---

## âœ… Staging Environment Policies:
- No real-world production data allowed
- Testing accounts must be labeled as staging users
- Access logs retained for 30 days minimum
- All test emails, alerts, or notifications directed to sandbox addresses

---

**This document now serves as the canonical Staging Deployment Plan for JUNZI within the kOS ecosystem until formally revised.**
