# JUNZI Phase 0: Vision Formation and Ethical Imperative Declaration

## Overview
Phase 0 serves as the philosophical genesis of the JUNZI Project. This phase focuses on defining the moral necessity, systemic purpose, and foundational vision that justifies JUNZI’s existence. It establishes the ethical imperatives driving the system’s creation and outlines the initial mandate for all subsequent phases.

---

## Purpose of Phase 0
- To articulate **why** JUNZI must exist
- To define the **ethical voids** JUNZI aims to address
- To establish the **foundational vision** and long-term moral trajectory
- To gather **cross-disciplinary consensus** on the ethical mission

---

## Core Objectives

1. **Ethical Imperative Declaration (EID)**
   - Recognize global challenges around algorithmic bias, social injustice, lack of transparency, and ethical drift in AI systems
   - Affirm the moral obligation to build ethical governance infrastructures for future human-AI societies

2. **Vision Statement Development**
   - Draft a unifying statement that encapsulates JUNZI’s mission, values, and long-term purpose
   - Establish guiding language for outreach, stakeholder communication, and partner alignment

3. **Problem Landscape Mapping**
   - Identify systemic gaps in current ethical governance technologies
   - Map social, legal, environmental, and technological risk factors motivating JUNZI’s creation

4. **Stakeholder Moral Consensus Building**
   - Conduct foundational workshops with ethicists, technologists, legal experts, and public interest groups
   - Document consensus points and unresolved ethical tensions for future resolution

5. **Foundational Ethical Commitments**
   - Codify initial commitments:
     - Non-manipulation of stakeholders
     - Transparency by default
     - User agency and consent at all levels
     - Continuous ethical evolution and auditability
