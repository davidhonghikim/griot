# JUNZI Dispute Resolution Process Design

**Node Class:** JunziNode  
**System:** kOS Ecosystem  
**Purpose:** To ensure that all entities affected by JUNZI outputs (e.g., contradiction flags, risk scores, public alerts) have a clear, fair, and auditable path for challenging, clarifying, or appealing system findings.

## Dispute Resolution Lifecycle:

### üì• Stage 1: Dispute Submission
| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Endpoint | `/junzi/api/v1/disputes/` |
| Required Fields | Entity ID, Dispute Type, Description, Supporting Evidence, Contact Information |
| Optional | Request for expedited review (with justification) |

### üö• Stage 2: Initial Triage by JUNZI Moderation Agents
| Action | Timeline |
|---|---|
| Validate Submission | Within 48 hours |
| Categorize Dispute | Factual Error, Contextual Misclassification, Bias Concern, Data Integrity Issue |
| Respond to Entity | Acknowledgement with expected timeline |

### üîé Stage 3: Investigation Phase
| Responsible Party | Scope |
|---|---|
| JUNZI Internal Review Team | Examine source data, model output, bias audit logs, provenance metadata |
| Optional Consultation | External data providers, cross-node verification (YachayNode for history, OracleNode for pattern context) |

### üèõÔ∏è Stage 4: Escalation (If Required)
| Trigger | Destination |
|---|---|
| High-risk cases, unresolved disputes, or bias allegations | Community Feedback Council (CFC) or Ethical Governance Board (EGB) |

### üìù Stage 5: Ruling & Resolution
| Outcome Types | Details |
|---|---|
| Dispute Upheld | Correct the affected JUNZI output, issue public correction, notify downstream nodes (Griot, Oracle, Yachay) |
| Dispute Dismissed | Provide formal justification with full evidence audit trail |
| Partial Resolution | Apply clarification labels, contextual notes, or update entity profile with explanatory metadata |

### üì¢ Stage 6: Transparency and Public Notification
| Scenario | Action |
|---|---|
| Any Dispute Affecting Public Records | Public-facing log entry with resolution summary and reasoning |
| High-Profile Cases | Optional press release or special notice through CommunicatorNode channels |

## Response Time Standards:
| Dispute Level | Target Resolution Time |
|---|---|
| Low Severity | 7 business days |
| Medium Severity | 14 business days |
| High Severity / Public Figures | 3 business days (expedited review) |

---

## Governance & Oversight:
- All dispute decisions logged in **VaultNode** for tamper-proof audit trails.
- Quarterly random sample audits by the **Ethical Governance Board (EGB)**.
- Annual public report summarizing number and types of disputes received, resolved, and escalated.
