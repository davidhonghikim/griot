# JUNZI Phase 2 - Detailed Technical Specification: Policy and Action Simulator (PAS)

## Module Name:

Policy and Action Simulator (PAS)

## Module Purpose:

The PAS provides a controlled simulation environment to test the ethical impact, system behavior, and risk profile of new or modified policies, rule sets, and actions before they are deployed live within JUNZI. It ensures that all updates undergo rigorous ethical scenario testing and stress analysis.

---

## System Architecture

### Simulation Workflow Pipeline:

1. **Scenario Generator:**

   - Allows users to create synthetic ethical decision scenarios.
   - Supports manual configuration and random scenario generation.
   - Includes pre-loaded edge-case scenario templates (e.g., stakeholder conflict, consent failure, regulatory breach).

2. **Policy Loader:**

   - Imports draft or proposed rule sets from DERE for simulation.
   - Supports version-specific testing.

3. **Action Simulator Core:**

   - Executes decision flows as JEDE would, but in a sandboxed environment.
   - Incorporates CAM-generated context bundles for realistic simulation inputs.

4. **Outcome Evaluator:**

   - Scores each simulated decision against predefined Ethical Performance Metrics (EPMs).
   - Logs all decision traces, rule matches, conflicts, and consent checks.

5. **Ethical Stress Test Engine:**

   - Runs high-frequency, randomized decision bursts to stress-test ethical logic under load.
   - Monitors system stability and ethical consistency at scale.

6. **Reporting and Export Layer:**

   - Generates human-readable simulation outcome reports.
   - Supports export formats: JSON, CSV, PDF.
   - Flags any test cases that exceed risk thresholds or violate ethical baselines.

## Algorithms and Models

1. **Ethical Scenario Randomizer:**

   - Generates randomized context-action-stakeholder pairings within defined ethical boundaries.

2. **Ethical Performance Metric (EPM) Calculator:**

   - Tracks and scores:
     - Conflict Rate
     - Consent Violation Rate
     - Ethical Drift Factor
     - Decision Latency

3. **Stress Testing Load Generator:**

   - Uses multi-threaded, asynchronous execution patterns to simulate large decision volumes.

---

## Performance Targets

- **Simulation Throughput:** 1,000+ simulated decisions per minute (scalable with cluster deployment)
- **Scenario Creation Latency:** Under 2 seconds per new scenario definition
- **Stress Test Duration:** Up to 1M simulated decisions per batch

---

## Monitoring and Metrics

- **Simulation Execution Time**
- **Ethical Error Detection Rate**
- **Resource Utilization During Stress Tests**
- **Scenario Success/Failure Ratio**

Monitoring Tools: Prometheus + Grafana dashboards with ethical performance KPIs.

---

## Security Considerations

- Isolated sandbox runtime
- API authentication for scenario creation and execution
- Rate limiting on stress test triggers
- Data encryption for simulation logs

---

## Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests:**

  - Scenario parsing
  - Outcome evaluation accuracy

- **Integration Tests:**

  - PAS → JEDE sandbox execution flow
  - PAS → DERE policy loading

- **Stress Tests:**

  - Full ethical stress test cycle

- **Ethical Integrity Tests:**

  - Verification against known ethical benchmarks

---

## Deployment Profile

- **Language:** Python 3.11, Node.js 18+, or GoLang
- **Containerization:** Docker + Kubernetes
- **Storage:** PostgreSQL or MongoDB for simulation history

---

## Dependencies

- JEDE (for simulated decision processing)
- DERE (for rule imports)
- CAM (for realistic context bundles)
- EAT (optional, for test logging if desired)
