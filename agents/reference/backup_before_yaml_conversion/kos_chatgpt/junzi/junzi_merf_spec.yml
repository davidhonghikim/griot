# JUNZI Phase 6 - Detailed Technical Specification: Multi-Node Ethical Reasoning Federation (MERF)

## Module Name:

Multi-Node Ethical Reasoning Federation (MERF)

## Module Purpose:

MERF enables decentralized, consensus-based ethical reasoning across multiple geographically distributed JUNZI nodes. It allows for collaborative, multi-node decision processing during high-impact or cross-jurisdictional ethical scenarios, ensuring consistency, fairness, and collective ethical intelligence.

---

## System Architecture

### Federated Reasoning Pipeline:

1. **Distributed Query Initiator:**

   - JEDE instances flag decisions requiring multi-node ethical reasoning.
   - Initiates MERF reasoning request with decision context payload.

2. **Peer Reasoning Orchestrator:**

   - Distributes reasoning payload to participating MERF nodes.
   - Supports minimum quorum-based participation (default: 5 nodes).

3. **Node-Level Reasoning Engine:**

   - Each node independently runs its JEDE instance against the received scenario.
   - Applies local rule sets, stakeholder models, and context filters.

4. **Federated Aggregation Layer:**

   - Collects reasoning outputs from each participating node.
   - Applies consensus protocols:
     - Simple Majority
     - Weighted Trust Consensus
     - Supermajority (for critical decisions)

5. **Decision Finalization Module:**

   - Consolidates consensus output.
   - Returns final federated decision back to initiating JEDE.

6. **Consensus Audit Logger:**

   - Logs all reasoning inputs, individual node decisions, and final consensus outcome into EAT and ELTE.

7. **Fail-Safe Fallback:**

   - If quorum is not reached within predefined time (default: 2 minutes), defers decision to GESP for escalation.

## Data Models

### Federated Reasoning Request:

```json
{
  "request_id": "uuid",
  "initiating_node": "uuid",
  "decision_context": "JSON",
  "required_quorum": "integer",
  "decision_priority": "Normal | High | Critical",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601"
}
```

### Node Reasoning Response:

```json
{
  "response_id": "uuid",
  "request_id": "uuid",
  "node_id": "uuid",
  "reasoning_result": "Allow | Deny | Modify | Abstain",
  "rationale_summary": "string",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601"
}
```

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint                                   | Method | Description                                  |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| /merf/initiate-reasoning                   | POST   | Starts a federated reasoning session         |
| /merf/submit-node-response                 | POST   | Participating node submits reasoning result  |
| /merf/get-consensus-result/{request\_id}   | GET    | Retrieves final federated decision           |
| /merf/get-reasoning-history/{decision\_id} | POST   | Returns full reasoning and consensus history |

---

## Algorithms and Logic

1. **Consensus Protocol Engine:**

   - Supports configurable consensus modes (Simple Majority, Weighted Trust, Supermajority).

2. **Reasoning Timeout Controller:**

   - Monitors time to quorum; triggers GESP fallback if exceeded.

3. **Rationale Aggregation Module:**

   - Compiles and summarizes rationale inputs from each node for stakeholder review.

---

## Performance Targets

- **Decision-to-Consensus Time:** Under 2 minutes for standard quorum decisions
- **Node Response Latency:** Under 1 minute per participating node
- **Consensus Failure Rate:** <1% per month

---

## Monitoring and Metrics

- **Federated Decision Volume**
- **Average Consensus Time**
- **Quorum Failure Rate**
- **Node Participation Rates**

Monitoring Tools: Prometheus + Grafana; Federated Reasoning Health dashboards.

---

## Security Considerations

- Mutual TLS for all inter-node communications
- Federated node identity verification with cryptographic keys
- Tamper-proof consensus logs in EAT and ELTE
- Governance policy-controlled quorum thresholds

---

## Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests:**

  - Consensus logic calculations
  - Quorum monitoring algorithms

- **Integration Tests:**

  - MERF â†” JEDE, GESP, EAT, ELTE workflows

- **Load Tests:**

  - High-frequency federated decision load simulations

- **Resilience Tests:**

  - Simulated node dropout during active reasoning cycles

---

## Deployment Profile

- **Language:** GoLang or Python 3.11 (for distributed coordination)
- **Containerization:** Docker + Kubernetes (with regional node federation overlays)
- **Storage:** PostgreSQL for reasoning records; S3 for decision payload archives

---

## Dependencies

- JEDE API
- EAT API
- GESP API
- ELTE API
