# JUNZI Phase 5 - Detailed Technical Specification: Ethical Knowledge Base (EKB)

## Module Name:

Ethical Knowledge Base (EKB)

## Module Purpose:

The EKB serves as JUNZI's centralized, curated repository for ethical knowledge, decision rationales, stakeholder value mappings, ethical case studies, historical incidents, and system learning logs. It supports JEDE reasoning, AREE rule drafting, EPR pattern validation, and stakeholder trust transparency.

---

## System Architecture

### Knowledge Ingestion Pipeline:

1. **Data Source Integrator:**

   - Ingests from:
     - EAT (Ethical decision traces)
     - PAS (simulation outputs)
     - SFL (stakeholder feedback summaries)
     - EDM (drift event records)
     - RAME (risk mitigation actions)
     - External ethics research datasets (optional)

2. **Knowledge Curation Engine:**

   - Applies NLP-based summarization and classification models.
   - Filters redundant or low-value entries.
   - Tags entries with:
     - Ethical principles impacted
     - Stakeholder group relevance
     - Decision outcome type

3. **Semantic Knowledge Graph Builder:**

   - Links related entries via entity and concept mapping.
   - Builds cross-reference nodes between decisions, incidents, rules, and feedback.

4. **Query and Retrieval API Layer:**

   - Provides efficient keyword, semantic, and contextual search endpoints.
   - Supports JEDE real-time ethical reasoning queries.

5. **Ethics Research Exporter:**

   - Generates anonymized, aggregate datasets for external research partners.

6. **Feedback Loop Integration:**

   - Updates models and search indexes with every new knowledge entry.
   - Links with AREE for rule recommendation enrichment.

## Data Models

### Knowledge Entry Record:

```json
{
  "entry_id": "uuid",
  "entry_type": "DecisionTrace | EthicalIncident | StakeholderValue | RuleRationale | SimulationResult | DriftEvent",
  "summary": "string",
  "full_content": "string",
  "tags": ["string"],
  "linked_entities": ["uuid"],
  "created_at": "ISO8601",
  "source_modules": ["EAT", "PAS", "SFL", "EDM", "RAME", "External"]
}
```

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint                             | Method | Description                                           |
| ------------------------------------ | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| /ekb/add-entry                       | POST   | Adds a new knowledge entry                            |
| /ekb/get-entry/{entry\_id}           | GET    | Retrieves details of a specific entry                 |
| /ekb/search                          | POST   | Searches entries using keyword or semantic parameters |
| /ekb/export-for-research             | POST   | Generates anonymized research datasets                |
| /ekb/get-related-entries/{entry\_id} | GET    | Returns knowledge graph-linked entities               |

## Algorithms and Logic

1. **Knowledge Summarization Model:**

   - Uses transformer-based NLP summarization (e.g., BART, Pegasus).

2. **Semantic Linking Algorithm:**

   - Entity recognition + knowledge graph embedding models (e.g., Node2Vec, GraphSAGE).

3. **Contextual Search Engine:**

   - ElasticSearch + Semantic Vector Index (e.g., FAISS or Pinecone).

---

## Performance Targets

- **Entry Ingestion Latency:** Under 5 seconds per entry
- **Search Query Latency:** Under 500ms
- **Knowledge Graph Update Frequency:** Real-time or batch-mode every 10 minutes

---

## Monitoring and Metrics

- **Knowledge Growth Rate (entries/day)**
- **Query Success Rate**
- **Entry Redundancy Rate**
- **External Research Export Frequency**

Monitoring Tools: Prometheus + Grafana; Knowledge Health dashboards.

---

## Security Considerations

- PII scrubbing before external export
- RBAC for write and query access
- Audit logging for all knowledge modifications
- TLS encryption for all API endpoints

---

## Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests:**

  - Summarization logic accuracy
  - Search ranking validation

- **Integration Tests:**

  - EKB â†” JEDE, AREE, EPR, SFL data flows

- **Load Tests:**

  - High-volume ingestion and query simulations

- **Data Integrity Tests:**

  - Duplicate detection
  - Semantic graph consistency

---

## Deployment Profile

- **Language:** Python 3.11 (NLP and ML pipelines)
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL for structured data, ElasticSearch for search, Neo4j or TigerGraph for the semantic graph
- **Containerization:** Docker + Kubernetes

---

## Dependencies

- EAT API
- PAS API
- SFL API
- EDM API
- RAME API
- AREE API
