# Skald Module Specification: Backup and Disaster Recovery Orchestrator (BDRO)

## Module Name
**Skald Backup and Disaster Recovery Orchestrator (BDRO)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Skald Backup and Disaster Recovery Orchestrator (BDRO) provides a centralized system for scheduling, managing, verifying, and restoring backups of all critical Skald storage subsystems (WSPE, HEARS, OASDL, LTMS, CVSM, ALC). BDRO ensures system survivability and rapid restoration in case of catastrophic failure, data loss, or node-level disasters.

## Purpose
To protect Skald system continuity and data integrity by providing full backup lifecycle management, recovery testing, restore automation, and cross-node or offsite replication strategies for disaster recovery (DR) readiness.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Backup Scheduling and Execution
- **Configurable Backup Policies:** Define backup frequency, scope, and retention for each Skald storage subsystem.
- **Full and Incremental Backups:** Support both full snapshots and incremental data changes.
- **Backup Job Orchestration:** Coordinate multi-module, multi-node backup execution workflows.
- **Offsite Backup Support:** Export backups to external storage via ESIB connectors.

### 2. Backup Integrity Verification
- **Checksum Validation:** Ensure backup data integrity post-capture.
- **Automated Backup Health Checks:** Regularly scan backup archives for corruption or data loss.
- **Test Restore Runs:** Periodically perform simulated restores in isolated environments.

### 3. Restore and Recovery Automation
- **Granular Restore Options:** Restore entire system, individual modules, or specific datasets.
- **Restore Workflow Templates:** Provide pre-built recovery plans for common disaster scenarios.
- **Dependency-Aware Recovery:** Automatically restore dependent services in correct order.
- **Rollback Safety:** Allow dry-run validation before committing restores.

### 4. Monitoring, Reporting, and Alerting
- **Backup Job Dashboards:** Display job status, duration, and success/failure outcomes.
- **Alerting:** Notify admins of failed backups, restore failures, or missed schedules.
- **Historical Backup Logs:** Maintain full audit trail of all backup and restore operations.

### 5. Performance and Resource Optimization
- **Backup Window Management:** Schedule backups during low-usage periods.
- **Parallelized Backup Streams:** Optimize large dataset backups using multi-threaded execution.
- **Network Throttling:** Prevent backup operations from saturating network bandwidth.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Reliability:** Guaranteed restore success for last-known-good backups.
- **Scalability:** Support PB-scale storage backups.
- **Extensibility:** Support new Skald modules automatically via plugin architecture.
- **Security:** Encrypt all backup data in transit and at rest.

## Data Flow Diagram (Textual)

2. **Restore Trigger → BDRO Recovery Planner → Restore Executor → Target Skald Storage Module → Post-Restore Verification**

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** Admin Control Panel (ACP), External Backup Schedulers, DR Test Tools.
- **Output Interfaces:** External Storage Systems (via ESIB), Admin Dashboards (DVL), Audit Logging (ALC), Runtime Skald Modules.

## Configuration Options
- **Backup Frequency:** Per module (hourly, daily, weekly, on-demand).
- **Retention Duration:** Per backup type.
- **Encryption Settings:** Algorithm selection and key rotation.
- **Offsite Replication Targets:** S3, GCS, custom endpoints.

## Example Use Cases
- Nightly backup of all active workflow states and configuration snapshots.
- Full system restore after hardware failure.
- Restoring a single corrupted artifact repository from last backup.
- Performing a scheduled DR failover simulation.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **Custom Backup Plugin API:** For integrating with non-standard Skald modules.
- **Third-Party DR Tool Integration:** Sync with external DR orchestration platforms.
- **Dynamic Retention Policy Loader:** Adjust backup retention rules at runtime.

## Testing and Validation Plan
- Full backup/restore cycle tests.
- Simulated data corruption recovery scenarios.
- Offsite backup integrity validation.
- Restore job SLA benchmarking.

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **All Skald Storage Modules (WSPE, HEARS, OASDL, LTMS, CVSM, ALC)**
- **External Storage Integration Broker (ESIB)**
- **Admin Control Panel (ACP)**
- **Audit Logging and Compliance Engine (ALC)**

## Future Enhancements
- AI-driven backup scheduling based on load forecasts.
- Continuous data protection (CDP) support.
- Multi-region disaster recovery playbook generator.
- Immutable backup archives for ransomware protection.
