# Skald Module Specification: Dashboard API and External Export Layer (DAEEL)

## Module Name
**Skald Dashboard API and External Export Layer (DAEEL)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Skald Dashboard API and External Export Layer (DAEEL) provides standardized, secure, and performant REST and WebSocket APIs for external tools, dashboards, and business intelligence (BI) platforms to access Skald system data, metrics, logs, output quality scores, SLA stats, and historical trends. It also handles scheduled and on-demand exports of dashboard data to external storage and reporting systems.

## Purpose
To enable external reporting, monitoring, analytics, and auditing systems to programmatically access and consume Skald dashboard data, supporting integration with third-party BI tools, corporate monitoring platforms, and compliance reporting pipelines.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Dashboard Data APIs
- **Metrics API:** Expose real-time and historical metrics from LTMS and MTVE.
- **Workflow API:** Provide status, history, and execution metadata for workflows (from WEM, HEARS).
- **Output Quality API:** Serve quality scores and feedback metrics (from WOQEE, OQFD).
- **SLA Status API:** Return current SLA compliance stats and historical breach records (from SCRD).
- **Incident API:** Allow external query of incidents and errors (from EIRC).

### 2. Export Services
- **On-Demand Exports:** Allow external users to trigger exports of selected dashboard datasets.
- **Scheduled Export Jobs:** Support admin-configurable recurring exports (daily, weekly, monthly).
- **Format Support:** Provide data in CSV, JSON, Parquet, or custom user-defined formats.
- **Destination Flexibility:** Support export to local file system, external object storage (via ESIB), or direct API endpoints.

### 3. Access Control and Security
- **API Authentication:** Support API keys, OAuth2, or SSO tokens.
- **Role-Based API Access:** Restrict API endpoints based on user permissions.
- **Rate Limiting:** Enforce request rate caps to prevent misuse.
- **Audit Logging:** Record all API accesses and export job triggers in ALC.

### 4. Query Optimization and Caching
- **Result Caching:** Cache frequent API queries for performance.
- **Pagination Support:** For large dataset exports and queries.
- **Query Filter Parameters:** Allow filtering by time range, module, user, workflow ID, and more.

### 5. Monitoring and Reporting
- **API Usage Metrics:** Track API call volume, success rate, and latency.
- **Export Job Status Dashboard:** Display running, completed, and failed export jobs.
- **Failure Alerting:** Notify admins of failed export jobs or unauthorized API access attempts.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **API Latency:** Sub-300ms for standard queries.
- **Scalability:** Handle thousands of API requests per minute.
- **Extensibility:** Support new dashboard data types without full redeployment.
- **Compliance:** Support audit-grade export logging.

## Data Flow Diagram (Textual)
1. **API Call or Export Trigger → DAEEL API Gateway → Data Aggregators (MTVE, WOQEE, SCRD, etc.) → Data Formatter → Response / Export Storage / External Endpoint → Audit Logging (ALC)**

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** Admin Control Panel (ACP), External API Clients, Export Job Scheduler.
- **Output Interfaces:** External BI Tools, Object Storage Targets, External HTTP/S Endpoints, Audit Logging (ALC).

## Configuration Options
- **API Rate Limits:** Per user or tenant.
- **Allowed Export Formats:** Configurable.
- **Export Job Retention Window:** Duration of export logs.
- **Authentication Mode:** API Key / OAuth2 / SSO.

## Example Use Cases
- Querying daily workflow execution stats via REST API.
- Exporting weekly SLA compliance data to an S3 bucket.
- Streaming real-time error events into a third-party SIEM tool.
- Pulling monthly quality trend data for a corporate BI dashboard.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **Custom API Endpoints:** Allow extension for organization-specific data views.
- **External Data Sink Plugins:** Support pushing exports to external databases.
- **GraphQL API Layer:** Optional future interface for flexible queries.

## Testing and Validation Plan
- API performance benchmarking.
- Access control enforcement tests.
- Export format correctness validation.
- Audit log accuracy for all API/export actions.

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **All Skald Dashboard Modules (ACP, MTVE, WEM, OQFD, SCRD, EIRC, HATV)**
- **Audit Logging and Compliance Engine (ALC)**
- **External Storage Integration Broker (ESIB)**

## Future Enhancements
- GraphQL API support.
- Webhook-based push updates.
- Real-time streaming data channels.
- AI-driven API usage anomaly detection.
