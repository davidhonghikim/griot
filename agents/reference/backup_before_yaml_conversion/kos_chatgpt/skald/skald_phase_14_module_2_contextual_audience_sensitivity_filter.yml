# Skald Phase 14 - Module 2: Contextual Audience Sensitivity Filter (CASF)

## Node Class: Skald (Communication & Expression)

## Phase 14 Focus:
Ethical Reasoning and Audience Impact Control Layer

---

## 1. Module Overview
The **Contextual Audience Sensitivity Filter (CASF)** serves as a dynamic audience-focused layer for all Skald content outputs. Its primary role is to ensure communication is appropriate, respectful, and context-aware for all intended audience segments.

The CASF works alongside the **Skald Global Ethical Policy Decision Engine (GEPDE)** but specializes in evaluating audience-specific sensitivities such as age, culture, trauma risk, and professional setting.

---

## 2. Primary Functions

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Audience Profiling Engine** | Ingests and analyzes audience metadata (age, culture, education level, language fluency, professional role, etc). |
| **Sensitivity Risk Mapper** | Identifies audience-specific sensitivities and creates real-time risk profiles per output. |
| **Tone Modulation Engine** | Adjusts language tone (formal, casual, child-appropriate, trauma-sensitive, etc). |
| **Content Framing and Redaction Layer** | Automatically reframes or redacts sensitive content based on risk analysis. |
| **Multi-Audience Conflict Handler** | Resolves conflicts when multiple audience groups with differing sensitivities are targeted simultaneously. |
| **Cultural Localization Filter** | Adapts content for region-specific norms, taboos, or linguistic framing preferences. |
| **User Sensitivity Preference Handler** | Honors user-defined sensitivity preferences (where permitted by policy). |
| **Real-time Sensitivity Alert System** | Flags high-risk content for manual or automated review before release. |

---

## 3. Data Inputs

| Input | Source |
| --- | --- |
| **Audience Context Metadata** | Supplied by Skald Contextual Trigger Engine or external source modules |
| **Draft Content (Pre-Ethics Layer)** | From Skald Story Assembly Engine or upstream modules |
| **Active Sensitivity Profiles** | Pulled from local or organizational sensitivity policy packs |
| **User/Org Sensitivity Overrides (Optional)** | Configuration-defined |

---

## 4. Data Outputs

| Output | Destination |
| --- | --- |
| **Sensitivity-Adjusted Content Draft** | Sent downstream to GEPDE for ethical validation |
| **Audience Impact Metadata Tags** | Attached for audit logging and downstream reference |
| **Risk Level Annotation** | Sent to kOS Global Audit Layer and next Skald processing layer |
| **Conflict Resolution Notes (If Needed)** | Logged for audit and human-in-the-loop review if escalated |

---

## 5. Processing Pipeline

1. Receive audience profile and draft content
2. Load active sensitivity policy pack
3. Generate sensitivity risk map for target audience
4. Adjust tone, framing, language, and content as needed
5. Revalidate adjusted content against audience profiles
6. Annotate output with sensitivity metadata
7. Forward to GEPDE for ethics pass

---

## 6. Sensitivity Profile Schema

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Profile ID** | Unique identifier per sensitivity profile |
| **Audience Type** | Child, Corporate, Trauma Survivors, Multilingual, etc |
| **Trigger Keywords** | Word and phrase patterns requiring adjustment or removal |
| **Risk Scoring Rules** | Numeric or categorical risk levels per audience segment |
| **Adjustment Logic** | Substitution rules, tone modulation parameters, redaction settings |
| **Localization Data** | Regional linguistic and cultural settings |

---

## 7. Deployment Options

| Configurable Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Default Sensitivity Pack** | Skald global defaults (child, academic, corporate, trauma-informed, etc) |
| **Custom Organizational Profiles** | Enterprise-specific audience sensitivity rules |
| **User-Specific Overrides** | Optional, based on deployment settings |
| **Regional Localization Sets** | Country or region-specific content framing |
| **Risk Threshold Settings** | Allow administrators to tune risk tolerance levels |

---

## 8. Governance Hooks

- Real-time risk escalation triggers
- Multi-agent sensitivity review process
- Sensitivity drift detection and automatic retraining prompts
- Profile versioning and update tracking
- Audit-ready logs of sensitivity decisions and adjustments

---

## 9. Example Use Case Scenarios

| Scenario | CASF Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Youth-focused educational chatbot** | Simplify vocabulary, block mature content, add age-appropriate explanations |
| **Corporate training module** | Formalize tone, strip colloquial language, ensure compliance language |
| **Mental health assistant for trauma survivors** | Apply trauma-sensitive language filters, avoid triggering terms |
| **Multicultural global announcement** | Normalize idioms, remove culturally offensive metaphors, apply global English style |
| **Power user requesting low filtering** | Minimize adjustments, log increased risk exposure |

---

## 10. Module Integration Points

| Module | Integration |
| --- | --- |
| **Skald Contextual Trigger Engine** | Provides audience metadata feed |
| **Skald Story Assembly Engine** | Supplies pre-ethics content draft |
| **GEPDE** | Performs final ethics check on CASF-adjusted content |
| **kOS Global Audit Layer** | Archives audience sensitivity decision logs |

---

## 11. Future Roadmap

- Machine learning-driven audience sensitivity prediction
- Psychographic real-time mood detection for conversational agents
- Geo-sensitive humor and metaphor handling layer
- Continuous sensitivity drift monitoring with self-tuning profiles
