# Skald Module Specification: Personality and Tone Engine (PTE)

## Module Name
**Personality and Tone Engine (PTE)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Personality and Tone Engine (PTE) is the Skald submodule responsible for adjusting, controlling, and dynamically shifting the narrative voice, tone, formality level, humor style, and overall personality style of any Skald-generated content. The PTE ensures that output matches the intended persona, audience expectations, and desired emotional effect.

## Purpose
To deliver highly adaptive, audience-specific content with controlled personality and tone, ranging from professional and formal to playful, humorous, sarcastic, or deeply empathetic outputs.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Personality Profiles
- **Predefined Personas:** Technical Assistant, Friendly Guide, Serious Academic, Comedian, Empathic Counselor, etc.
- **Custom User-Defined Personas:** Allow users or developers to define new personality templates.
- **Dynamic Persona Switching:** Allow real-time or context-driven persona changes within a single session.

### 2. Tone Adjustment
- **Formality Scaling:** Informal ↔ Semi-formal ↔ Formal.
- **Emotional Tone Biasing:** Inject sentiment bias (optimistic, neutral, cautionary, etc.).
- **Humor Control:** Toggle and scale humor intensity (Dry → Playful → Silly → Absurd).
- **Sarcasm/Irony Toggle:** Optionally enable or suppress sarcastic tones.

### 3. Output Styling
- **Sentence Length Variance:** Adjust verbosity level.
- **Vocabulary Complexity:** Control reading level (Basic → Intermediate → Advanced).
- **Cultural Localization:** Adjust idioms, references, and phrasing to target audience norms.
- **Pacing and Rhythm Control:** Slow, moderate, fast pacing in narrative flow.

### 4. Multi-Modal Tone Control
- **Text-to-Speech Voice Style Mapping:** Match voice synthesis parameters with chosen personality.
- **Multi-Language Tone Equivalence:** Ensure tone consistency across translations.
- **Emoji and Visual Marker Injection:** For chat-based outputs.

### 5. AI & ML Integration
- **Transformer-based Tone Control Models:** Use fine-tuned LLMs for nuanced tone shifts.
- **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF):** Adapt persona responses based on user ratings.
- **Zero-Shot Persona Transfer:** Ability to emulate new personality types from minimal examples.

### 6. Session Context Awareness
- **Memory of Prior Persona States:** Maintain tone consistency across long conversations.
- **Contextual Shifts:** Adjust tone mid-output if conversation sentiment shifts drastically.
- **Multi-Party Tone Management:** Adapt tone for group conversations (e.g., mixed audience sensitivity).

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Latency:** Sub-500ms for personality-tuned short text outputs.
- **Scalability:** Support for thousands of concurrent persona-adjusted outputs.
- **Customizability:** High degree of configuration via developer API and user-facing settings.
- **Reliability:** Predictable and repeatable tone adjustments across sessions.

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** Skald Narrative Generator, Skald Summary Engine, external API calls.
- **Output Interfaces:** Skald Output Formatter, TTS Module, External Delivery Channels.

## Configuration Options
- **Active Persona:** (Selectable from preset or custom profiles)
- **Tone Level:** (Casual / Neutral / Formal)

- Providing academic summaries with formal, technical language.
- Generating satirical commentary with heavy sarcasm and irony.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **Custom Persona Scripts:** Developers can upload custom tone adjustment scripts.
- **Third-Party Tone APIs:** Optional external tone refinement integration.
- **Multi-Personality Blending:** Support for hybrid personas (e.g., "Sarcastic Academic").

## Testing and Validation Plan
- AB tests with human reviewers for tone accuracy.
- NLP benchmark tests for persona consistency.
- Latency and load tests under high concurrency.
- Bias and fairness audits for generated outputs.

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **Skald NLP Engine**
- **Skald Sentiment and Emotion Engine**
- **LLM Hosting Service (local or external)**

## Future Enhancements
- Real-time user-adjustable tone sliders during conversation.
- Emotion-adaptive persona switching.
- Audience-profile driven auto-tone adjustment.
- Support for literary styles (e.g., Shakespearean, Noir, Sci-Fi).
