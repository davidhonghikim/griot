# Skald Module Specification: Data Retention and Purging Policy Manager (DRPPM)

## Module Name
**Skald Data Retention and Purging Policy Manager (DRPPM)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Skald Data Retention and Purging Policy Manager (DRPPM) governs the lifespan of all data stored within Skald, including workflow states, execution archives, artifacts, telemetry, logs, and configuration versions. DRPPM enforces organizational, legal, and ethical data retention policies, ensuring timely purging, archiving, or anonymization of aged or expired data.

## Purpose
To ensure Skald data lifecycle management complies with storage efficiency goals, legal mandates, ethical data governance standards, and user-defined retention preferences while minimizing storage bloat and compliance risk.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Retention Policy Framework
- **Policy Definition Engine:** Support creation of retention policies based on data type, user, workflow, tenant, or custom tags.
- **Policy Versioning:** Track history and versioning of retention policies.
- **Policy Scope Mapping:** Allow assignment of policies to specific modules, datasets, or artifact types.

### 2. Automated Purging Engine
- **Scheduled Purge Jobs:** Run regular background purging jobs based on active policies.
- **On-Demand Purge Trigger:** Support immediate purging via API or admin action.
- **Soft-Delete Mode:** Allow configurable grace periods before final deletion.
- **Permanent Deletion Mode:** Fully wipe data from all storage backends after retention expiry.

### 3. Archival and Anonymization Support
- **Pre-Purge Archival Hooks:** Allow data export to external storage before deletion.
- **Data Anonymization Policies:** Support field-level anonymization for privacy-compliance-driven retention needs.
- **Audit Pre-Purge Reports:** Generate detailed lists of data scheduled for deletion before purge execution.

### 4. Compliance and Auditing
- **Retention Compliance Reporting:** Generate reports showing data retention policy adherence.
- **Purge Action Logs:** Record metadata for each purge operation (what, when, why, who triggered).
- **Legal Hold Flags:** Allow override of retention policies for datasets under legal review or audit hold.

### 5. Safety and Recovery Controls
- **Purge Simulation Mode:** Test retention policies without actual deletion.
- **Recovery Window:** Configurable buffer period after purge where data can still be restored.
- **Purge Failure Handling:** Automatic retry and failure alerting.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability:** Support retention enforcement across petabyte-scale storage.
- **Latency:** Policy enforcement decisioning within 100ms per data record.
- **Reliability:** Ensure atomicity and consistency during purge actions.
- **Extensibility:** Support for new data types and storage modules.

## Data Flow Diagram (Textual)
1. **Retention Policy Definition → DRPPM Policy Engine → Scheduled/On-Demand Purge Trigger → Target Skald Storage Module → Purge Execution / Archival / Anonymization → Compliance Logging**

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** Admin Control Panel (ACP), Skald Storage Modules (WSPE, HEARS, OASDL, LTMS), External Legal Hold Systems.
- **Output Interfaces:** Audit Logging and Compliance Engine (ALC), External Storage (via ESIB), Admin Dashboards (DVL).

## Configuration Options
- **Policy Enforcement Mode:** Simulate / Live / Soft-Delete / Immediate.
- **Grace Period Duration:** Per data type.
- **Anonymization Rules:** Field-level.
- **Archival Targets:** External storage connectors.

## Example Use Cases
- Automatically purging telemetry older than 90 days.
- Exporting and then deleting workflow archives for GDPR compliance.
- Running a simulation of purge impact before enforcement.
- Applying legal hold to prevent deletion of specific datasets.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **Custom Policy Plugins:** For complex retention rules.
- **External Regulatory Compliance Integration:** Sync with external governance tools.
- **Dynamic Policy Loader:** Update retention rules at runtime.

## Testing and Validation Plan
- Policy rule evaluation accuracy tests.
- Simulated purge safety validation.
- Recovery window functionality testing.
- Performance benchmarking for large-scale purging.

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **All Skald Storage Modules (WSPE, HEARS, OASDL, LTMS)**
- **External Storage Integration Broker (ESIB)**
- **Audit Logging and Compliance Engine (ALC)**
- **Admin Control Panel (ACP)**

## Future Enhancements
- AI-assisted purge impact forecasting.
- Cross-node federated purge coordination.
- SLA-aware retention policies.
- GDPR and CCPA compliance templates.
