# Skald Phase 14 - Module 3: Responsible Humor Generation Layer (RHGL)

## Node Class: Skald (Communication & Expression)

## Phase 14 Focus:
Ethical Reasoning and Audience-Safe Humor Production

---

## 1. Module Overview
The **Responsible Humor Generation Layer (RHGL)** introduces specialized ethical and audience-aware control mechanisms for all humor-related content produced by Skald agents. Humor has high potential for cultural misinterpretation, emotional harm, or unintended offense, especially in global or sensitive contexts. RHGL ensures that humor remains contextually appropriate, ethically grounded, and audience-sensitive.

This module does not censor humor universally but provides adaptive filters, style modulation, and context-anchored risk assessments for humor output.

## 2. Primary Functions

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Humor Context Detection Engine** | Identifies when generated content contains or is intended as humor (explicit, satirical, sarcastic, ironic, etc). |
| **Audience Humor Sensitivity Profiler** | Analyzes audience tolerance and preferences for humor types (dry, slapstick, dark, cultural, satire, etc). |
| **Ethical Humor Risk Assessor** | Evaluates potential for offense, cultural insensitivity, or emotional harm. |
| **Tone Modulation and Adjustment Layer** | Adapts humor tone to match audience sensitivity and ethical guidelines. |
| **Cultural Reference Mapper** | Identifies and modifies culturally specific humor elements for target regions or demographics. |
| **Escalation and Review Pathways** | Flags high-risk humor content for manual review or multi-agent approval. |
| **User Humor Preference Handler** | Honors user-set humor preference levels when permissible (e.g., dry only, no dark humor, etc). |
| **Logging and Transparency Module** | Annotates humor outputs with ethical reasoning tags and decision logs for audit purposes. |

---

## 3. Data Inputs

| Input | Source |
| --- | --- |
| **Draft Content** | From Skald Story Assembly Engine |
| **Audience Profile Data** | From Skald Contextual Trigger Engine and CASF |
| **Active Ethical and Sensitivity Policies** | From GEPDE and CASF |
| **User Humor Preferences** | Where allowed by deployment policy |

---

## 4. Data Outputs

| Output | Destination |
| --- | --- |
| **Ethically-Filtered Humor Content** | Sent downstream for final ethics pass and output delivery |
| **Humor Risk Annotations** | Included in content metadata for audit logging |
| **Escalation Flags (If Applicable)** | Sent to GEPDE or Human Review Layer |

---

## 5. Processing Pipeline

1. Detect humor elements in content draft
2. Evaluate humor type and intensity
3. Cross-check audience humor sensitivity and preferences
4. Run ethical risk assessment (offense potential, cultural risk, emotional harm)
5. Adjust humor tone, language, and framing as needed
6. Generate risk annotation and decision log
7. Pass adjusted humor content to GEPDE for final ethical validation

---

## 6. Humor Risk Scoring Model

| Risk Level | Example Indicators |
| --- | --- |
| **Low** | Mild wordplay, light puns, non-offensive jokes |
| **Moderate** | Sarcasm, irony, cultural references with low risk |
| **High** | Dark humor, sensitive satire, political jokes, trauma-adjacent humor |
| **Extreme** | Content likely to cause harm, trigger trauma, or violate organizational ethics |

---

## 7. Deployment Options

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Default Humor Filter Profiles** | Conservative, Balanced, or Creative Freedom presets |
| **Custom Organizational Humor Policies** | Allow enterprises to define humor boundaries |
| **User Humor Sensitivity Settings** | User-tunable preferences (where allowed) |
| **Real-Time Humor Risk Escalation Thresholds** | Admin-defined cutoff points for auto-escalation |

---

## 8. Governance Hooks

- Humor risk drift detection
- Multi-agent or human review for flagged humor content
- Periodic humor sensitivity policy updates
- Audit logs on all humor filtering decisions

---

## 9. Example Use Case Scenarios

| Scenario | RHGL Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Childrenâ€™s educational agent** | Restrict humor to puns and non-sarcastic jokes |
| **Corporate internal announcement** | Remove sarcasm and culturally risky humor |
| **Comedy-focused content agent** | Allow broader humor range with clear disclaimers |
| **Multicultural public announcement** | Localize humor or replace with neutral messaging |
| **Trauma support chatbot** | Block dark humor and maintain supportive tone |

## 10. Module Integration Points

| Module | Integration |
| --- | --- |
| **CASF** | Provides audience humor sensitivity profiles |
| **GEPDE** | Validates humor content against ethical frameworks |
| **Skald Story Assembly Engine** | Supplies draft humor content for evaluation |
| **kOS Global Audit Layer** | Archives humor decision logs and risk scores |
