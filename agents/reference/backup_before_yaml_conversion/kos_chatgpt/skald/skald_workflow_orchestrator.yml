# Skald Module Specification: Workflow Orchestrator (SWO)

## Module Name
**Skald Workflow Orchestrator (SWO)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Skald Workflow Orchestrator (SWO) is the central execution management layer responsible for dynamically coordinating and sequencing Skald module operations. It enables complex, multi-step workflows across all Phase 4 Skald modules, managing inter-module data flow, dependency resolution, concurrency, and output integration.

## Purpose
To serve as the primary decision engine and task controller that assembles, schedules, and executes Skald workflows—ensuring seamless modular coordination for both real-time and batch operations.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Workflow Definition and Registration
- **Workflow Templates:** YAML/JSON based definitions of multi-step Skald workflows.
- **Dynamic Workflow Construction:** Build workflows on-the-fly based on user prompts, API calls, or system triggers.
- **Workflow Type Support:** Predefined (static), Ad-hoc (dynamic), or Hybrid workflows.

### 2. Execution Engine
- **Sequential Execution:** Stepwise execution of modules in specified order.
- **Parallel Execution:** Run independent workflow branches in parallel when possible.
- **Conditional Branching:** Support if/else logic and runtime decision points.
- **Looping and Iteration:** Allow repeat execution loops within a workflow.

### 3. Dependency Management
- **Input/Output Data Mapping:** Automatically map outputs from one module to inputs of the next.
- **Inter-Module Dependency Resolver:** Analyze workflow definitions and resolve execution dependencies.
- **Error Path Routing:** Automatically invoke error-handling flows if a step fails.

### 4. Runtime Control
- **Workflow Pause/Resume:** Allow external commands to pause, resume, or cancel active workflows.
- **Priority Queuing:** Queue workflows based on priority levels.
- **Timeout Management:** Abort or escalate workflows exceeding defined execution time limits.

### 5. Monitoring and Observability
- **Execution Logs:** Timestamped, stepwise logs of workflow progress.
- **Event Emission:** Broadcast workflow state changes to the kOS Event Bus.
- **Metrics Collection:** Track success rates, failure points, average execution times.

### 6. Security and Isolation
- **Sandboxed Execution:** Prevent cross-workflow data leakage.
- **Permission Controls:** Restrict sensitive workflows to authorized agents or users.
- **Audit Trail:** Full record of workflow invocations, parameters, and results.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Latency:** <200ms for simple workflows, scalable for larger flows.
- **Throughput:** Support for thousands of concurrent workflows.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Workflow checkpointing for recovery after crash or failure.
- **Extensibility:** Pluggable hooks for pre-processing, post-processing, and custom modules.

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** kOS Event Bus, Skald Workflow API, external systems.
- **Output Interfaces:** Skald Runtime Scheduler (SRS), Error Handler (EHR), kOS Notification Layer.

## Configuration Options
- **Max Concurrent Workflows:** (Default: 1000)
- **Execution Timeout:** (Default: 60 seconds per workflow)
- **Logging Level:** (Error/Info/Debug/Trace)
- **Workflow Retry Policy:** (None, Immediate Retry, Delayed Retry)

## Example Use Cases
- Orchestrating a translation + summarization + tone adjustment + output formatting sequence.
- Running a parallel sentiment + topic analysis on incoming chat streams.
- Executing a batch narrative generation flow across multiple data inputs.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **Custom Workflow Plugins:** Allow developers to inject custom steps.
- **Pre/Post Execution Hooks:** Trigger external system calls or notifications.
- **Dynamic Workflow Generator API:** Allow external LLMs or rule engines to generate workflows programmatically.

## Testing and Validation Plan
- Unit tests for all workflow step types.
- Concurrency and load tests with high workflow volumes.
- Error path simulation and recovery validation.
- Latency benchmarking.

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **All Skald Phase 4 Modules (CTE, TE, SSE, SEE, PTE, NGE, CMM, CFD, SOF)**
- **Skald Runtime Scheduler (SRS)**
- **Skald Error Handler (EHR)**

## Future Enhancements
- Visual Workflow Editor UI.
- AI-optimized workflow planning.
- Cross-node distributed workflow orchestration for large deployments.
- Real-time user-modifiable workflows during active execution.
