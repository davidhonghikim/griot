# Skald Module Specification: Cost and Resource Accounting Module (CRAM)

## Module Name
**Skald Cost and Resource Accounting Module (CRAM)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Skald Cost and Resource Accounting Module (CRAM) tracks and calculates resource consumption, operational costs, and usage-based billing metrics across Skald nodes, modules, workflows, and users. CRAM enables internal resource management, cost attribution, and optional external billing support.

## Purpose
To provide accurate, auditable accounting of computational resources, API usage, and workflow execution costs for internal optimization, tenant reporting, and possible commercial billing models.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Resource Usage Accounting
- **Per-Workflow Resource Tracking:** Monitor CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network usage per workflow.
- **Per-User API Usage:** Track number and type of API calls per user.
- **Module Execution Time:** Calculate runtime and resource consumption per module instance.
- **Node-Level Aggregation:** Summarize resource usage per node.

### 2. Cost Calculation Engine
- **Cost Model Configurator:** Allow definition of unit costs per resource metric (e.g., $ per CPU second, $ per GB memory-hour).
- **Usage-to-Cost Mapping:** Calculate costs per workflow, user, tenant, or time period.
- **Dynamic Rate Support:** Support tiered or time-based pricing models.
- **Currency and Units Configurable:** Allow reporting in different currencies or resource units.

### 3. Billing and Quota Support
- **Quota Tracking:** Track usage against user, tenant, or project quotas.
- **Threshold Alerts:** Notify users approaching or exceeding quotas.
- **Invoice Generator (Optional):** Generate billing statements or cost breakdown reports.

### 4. Reporting and Export
- **Cost Analytics API:** Provide APIs to query cost and usage data.
- **Dashboard Integration:** Feed cost data to DVL for visualization.
- **Export Formats:** CSV, JSON, or external billing system formats.

### 5. Compliance and Auditing
- **Immutable Billing Logs:** Maintain non-editable logs of all cost calculations.
- **Historical Cost Retention:** Store cost data for defined retention periods.
- **Audit Trail:** Record adjustments, corrections, or retroactive rate changes.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Accuracy:** Sub-1% variance between calculated and actual resource consumption.
- **Scalability:** Track millions of workflows and API calls per day.
- **Latency:** Cost computation overhead <1% of total execution time.
- **Extensibility:** Support new resource types and pricing models.

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** Usage Metrics Collector (UMAC), Resource Utilization Monitor (RUM), Workflow State Tracker (WST).
- **Output Interfaces:** Dashboard and Visualization Layer (DVL), External Billing Systems, Notification Systems.

## Configuration Options
- **Unit Cost Definitions:** Per resource type.
- **Quota Profiles:** Per user, project, or tenant.
- **Currency Type:** USD, EUR, etc.
- **Report Periods:** Daily, Weekly, Monthly.

## Example Use Cases
- Tracking API usage costs per client for monthly billing.
- Monitoring internal resource costs for each workflow type.
- Sending quota threshold warnings to high-usage tenants.
- Generating cost breakdowns by node or module.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **Custom Cost Models:** Plug in alternative billing logic.
- **External Payment Gateway Integration:** For commercial Skald deployments.
- **AI-Powered Cost Prediction:** Forecast future costs based on usage trends.

## Testing and Validation Plan
- Resource-to-cost calculation accuracy tests.
- Quota threshold validation.
- High-volume usage accounting stress tests.
- Historical cost report generation tests.

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **Usage Metrics and Analytics Collector (UMAC)**
- **Resource Utilization Monitor (RUM)**
- **Workflow State Tracker (WST)**
- **Dashboard and Visualization Layer (DVL)**

## Future Enhancements
- AI-based cost optimization recommendations.
- Cost anomaly detection alerts.
- Multi-currency and multi-region billing support.
- User self-service billing and quota management portal.
