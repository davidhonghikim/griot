# Skald Module Specification: Adaptive Workflow Routing Engine (AWRE)

## Module Name
**Skald Adaptive Workflow Routing Engine (AWRE)**

## Node Class
**Skald**

## Overview
The Skald Adaptive Workflow Routing Engine (AWRE) dynamically adjusts workflow execution paths in real time based on system load, performance metrics, historical success rates, and user-defined optimization goals (e.g., latency, cost, resource consumption).

## Purpose
To intelligently route Skald workflows through the most efficient execution paths, selecting alternative modules, load-balanced nodes, or workflow branches to meet performance, reliability, and SLA objectives.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Dynamic Workflow Path Selection
- **Runtime Path Decision Engine:** Choose optimal execution paths for workflows during runtime.
- **Branching Control:** Enable or bypass workflow branches based on runtime conditions.
- **Alternate Module Routing:** Select alternate module instances or node locations based on availability and performance.

### 2. Input Signals for Routing Decisions
- **Resource Load Metrics:** CPU, memory, I/O, and network utilization from RUM and UMAC.
- **Workflow Performance History:** Module and path success/failure rates.
- **User-Defined Goals:** Admin-configured routing priorities (e.g., low-cost, low-latency, high-reliability).
- **Forecasted Load:** Input from RUPLFE for proactive routing.

### 3. Routing Policy Framework
- **Policy Profiles:** Support multiple routing policy modes (Performance-Optimized, Cost-Optimized, Reliability-Optimized).
- **SLA Compliance Awareness:** Factor SLA deadlines into routing decisions.
- **Custom Policy API:** Allow users to define custom routing logic plugins.

### 4. Feedback and Learning Loop
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Track execution outcomes for future decision tuning.
- **Auto-Learning Mode:** Adapt routing decisions over time based on observed results.
- **Admin Feedback Integration:** Allow manual override or feedback on routing decisions.

### 5. Failover and Recovery
- **Fallback Routing Paths:** Automatically re-route workflows upon failure.
- **Retry Logic:** Apply retry policies for failed execution paths.
- **Dead Path Detection:** Deprioritize persistently failing paths.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Latency:** Path decision overhead <10ms per workflow step.
- **Scalability:** Support adaptive routing for tens of thousands of concurrent workflows.
- **Resilience:** Fail-safe defaults if AWRE is unavailable.
- **Extensibility:** Support plug-in decision models.

## Data Flow Diagram (Textual)

## Interfaces
- **Input Interfaces:** Workflow Orchestrator (SWO), Resource Utilization Monitor (RUM), Usage Metrics (UMAC), SLA Enforcement Layer (SQL).
- **Output Interfaces:** Runtime Scheduler (SRS), Admin Dashboards, Audit Logging (ALC).

## Configuration Options
- **Routing Policy Mode:** Performance / Cost / Reliability / Custom.
- **Latency Thresholds:** For performance-triggered rerouting.
- **Auto-Learning Mode:** On / Off / Manual Feedback Only.
- **Retry Limits:** Per workflow or module type.

## Example Use Cases
- Rerouting workflows away from overloaded nodes during traffic spikes.
- Prioritizing low-cost execution paths for batch jobs.
- Auto-adjusting narrative generation steps to meet tight SLA deadlines.
- Skipping non-critical workflow steps during resource exhaustion.

## Extensibility Hooks
- **Custom Decision Models:** Support AI or rules-based path selection plugins.
- **External SLA Policy Provider Integration:** Allow dynamic SLA input.
- **Dynamic Policy Update API:** Allow real-time routing policy changes.

## Testing and Validation Plan
- Routing decision latency benchmarking.
- Policy compliance tests.
- Failure scenario validation.
- Learning model drift detection.

## Dependencies
- **kOS Event Bus**
- **Workflow Orchestrator (SWO)**
- **Resource Utilization Monitor (RUM)**
- **Usage Metrics and Analytics Collector (UMAC)**
- **Audit Logging and Compliance Engine (ALC)**

## Future Enhancements
- AI-reinforced routing decisions.
- SLA breach prediction-driven path adjustment.
- Multi-node cluster-aware routing optimizations.
- Visual workflow routing path dashboards.
