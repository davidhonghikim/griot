# ✅ kOS Scalable Process Framework Phase-by-Phase Risk Assessment

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Solo Developer Deployment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Incorrect Node Class organization | Medium | Medium | Provide clear folder and naming conventions upfront |
| Local environment setup failures | High | Medium | Provide Docker Compose starter file and `.env.example` |
| Agent-state inconsistency | Medium | Low | Implement simple logging for agent sessions |
| Ethics step skipped | Medium | Low | Include mandatory manual ethics checklist |

---

## ✅ Phase 2: Team Scale – CI/CD + Testing

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| CI/CD misconfigurations | Medium | High | Use template CI configs, provide test pipelines |
| Drift detection false positives | High | Medium | Tune Mzee thresholds carefully, log all drift events |
| Low test coverage | High | Medium | Enforce coverage checks in CI |
| Ethics gate bypassed | Medium | High | Make Junzi checks blocking in CI |
| Multi-env variable mismatch | Medium | Medium | Maintain centralized `.env` variable documentation |

---

## ✅ Phase 3: Enterprise Multi-Node + Observability

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Kubernetes deployment failures | High | High | Use well-tested Helm charts, conduct staging dry-runs |
| Service mesh misrouting | Medium | High | Begin with simple routing rules, enable debug tracing |
| Monitoring gaps | High | High | Deploy Prometheus + Grafana before scaling workloads |
| Log volume overload | Medium | Medium | Implement log retention policies and filters |
| Governance misfires (Sachem misconfig) | Medium | High | Test governance flow with dummy approvals first |

---

## ✅ Phase 4: Federation and Global Mesh

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Peer discovery API exploits | Medium | High | Require signed join requests, whitelist known peers |
| Vector query inconsistency across nodes | High | High | Implement versioned vector schema syncing |
| Inter-node message interception | High | High | Enforce end-to-end KLF encryption with message signing |
| Knowledge drift across federated nodes | High | Medium | Log and track AKU propagation, implement reconciliation mechanisms |
| Governance fragmentation | Medium | High | Deploy global governance layer with distributed policy enforcement |

---

## ✅ Cross-Phase Systemic Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tech debt accumulation | High | High | Maintain documentation, enforce architectural review at each phase |
| Data schema drift | High | Medium | Use schema registries and backward compatibility checks |
| Ethical misalignment | Medium | High | Continuous Junzi policy audits |
| Agent drift and hallucination | High | Medium | Regular Mzee-based drift scoring and performance audits |
