# ✅ Overview

This document defines **recommended health check endpoints**, **monitoring practices**, and **logging strategies** for the **kOS Vector Store API** and **Weaviate backend**.

## ✅ Health Check Endpoints

| Service          | Endpoint                | Method | Expected Response                        |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Vector Store API | `/health`               | GET    | `{ "status": "ok", "uptime": "1234s" }`  |
| Vector Store API | `/metrics`              | GET    | Prometheus metrics format (for scraping) |
| Weaviate         | `/v1/.well-known/ready` | GET    | `200 OK` if Weaviate is healthy          |
| Weaviate         | `/v1/.well-known/live`  | GET    | `200 OK` if Weaviate is live             |

---

## ✅ Vector API `/health` Endpoint Example (FastAPI)

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter
import time

start_time = time.time()
router = APIRouter()

@router.get("/health")
def health_check():
    uptime = time.time() - start_time
    return {"status": "ok", "uptime": f"{int(uptime)}s"}
```

## ✅ Monitoring Stack Recommendation

| Layer                  | Tool                                    | Purpose                                          |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Metrics Collection     | **Prometheus**                          | Scrape `/metrics` from API and Weaviate          |
| Visualization          | **Grafana**                             | Visual dashboards for latency, queries, errors   |
| Alerting               | **Prometheus Alertmanager**             | Trigger alerts on downtime, error spikes         |
| Logs                   | **Docker + Filebeat + ELK (Optional)**  | Centralized logging if scaling to multiple nodes |
| External Health Checks | **UptimeRobot / StatusCake (Optional)** | Public availability monitoring                   |

## ✅ Logging Recommendations

| Layer      | Strategy                                                               |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Vector API | Log all POST and DELETE calls with payload size and agent ID           |
| Weaviate   | Use built-in logging and enable verbose logs in staging                |
| Docker     | Redirect container logs to centralized syslog or filebeat agent        |
| Errors     | Any 5xx or unhandled exception must log full stacktrace with timestamp |
| Metrics    | Track API latency, query counts, error rates per endpoint              |

---

## ✅ Example Prometheus Alert Rules

```yaml
groups:
  - name: vector-store-alerts
    rules:
      - alert: VectorAPI_Down
        expr: up{job="vector_api"} == 0
        for: 1m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "Vector API is down"

      - alert: Weaviate_Unhealthy
        expr: up{job="weaviate"} == 0
        for: 1m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "Weaviate backend is unhealthy"

      - alert: High_Query_Latency
        expr: rate(http_request_duration_seconds_sum[5m]) / rate(http_request_duration_seconds_count[5m]) > 1
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "Vector API response latency is high"
```

## ✅ Next Steps

1. Implement `/health` and `/metrics` endpoints in Vector API
2. Set up Prometheus scrape configs
3. Build Grafana dashboards
4. Configure Prometheus alert rules
