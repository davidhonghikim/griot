kOS:
  overview:
    description: |
      kOS (Kind Operating System) is an open-source, decentralized, modular, agent-driven AI operating system built for ethical, privacy-first, and regenerative digital ecosystems. It allows individuals and collectives to deploy intelligent agents across personal devices, edge nodes, mesh networks, and cloud services. Agents within kOS are modular, autonomous, collaborative, and capable of evolving their skills and behaviors over time.
