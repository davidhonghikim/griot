# ðŸ¤– Agent Editing Guidelines

This repo is edited by human contributors *and* automated AI agents.  To avoid merge
conflicts and maintain code quality, follow these conventions:

1. **One-file-per-commit** rule for autogenerated changes â€“ easier to revert.
2. **Docstrings before code** â€“ every public symbol must have a Google-style docstring.
3. **Dynamic imports** for optional heavy deps (`torch`, `llama_index`) to keep cold-start lean.
4. **No hard-coded model URLs** â€“ use `models.toml` indirection.
5. **Naming**: kebab-case for folders, snake_case for modules, UpperCamel for classes.
6. **Logging**: use `ai_kitchen.utils.logger.get_logger(__name__)` (planned) â€“ never `print()` in libs.
7. **Agent-only markers**: insert `# AUTO-GENERATED <date>` at top. Human edits must remove marker.
8. **Tests**: every new skill must ship with a `tests/` folder runnable via `pytest -q`.
