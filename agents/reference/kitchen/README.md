# üè† AI Kitchen Overview

AI Kitchen is the **hardware-aware runtime** that powers the Griot ‚ÄúKitchen‚Äù node and the Skald creator node.

* Auto-detect local GPUs / CPUs / accelerators.
* Dynamically loads *skills* (Python modules) and auto-installs missing pip dependencies.
* Exposes REST (and future gRPC) endpoints for skill execution and recipe orchestration.
* Designed for cross-platform packaging (Docker, Homebrew, winget, deb/rpm).
