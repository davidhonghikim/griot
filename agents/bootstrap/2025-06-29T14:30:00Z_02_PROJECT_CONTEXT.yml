  - "No persona-aware RAG requests or document retrieval"
  - "Missing database schema for persona storage and relationships"
  - "No persistent memory for persona interactions"
recommended_approach:
  - "Leverage existing infrastructure (MongoDB, Weaviate, Neo4j)"
  - "Build on proven RAG patterns (PricingRAGService)"
  - "Extend PersonaVectorizationService with RAG integration"
  - "Create incremental value through phased implementation"
  - "Follow GPT agent workflow requirements for any GPT-based agent interactions"
