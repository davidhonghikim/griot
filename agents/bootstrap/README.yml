  title: "Agent Bootstrap System"
  status: "OPTIMIZED FOR AI PROCESSING"
  description: |
    This directory contains the core bootstrap files for agent initialization and workflow management. These files provide the essential context and procedures that every agent needs to operate effectively on the kOS project.

directory_structure:
  title: "Directory Structure"
  note: |
    LOG FILES USE [TIMESTAMP]_FILENAME.ext format. Keep the timestamp in the filename as variable since it changes but there should only be one file like it in that directory as the current file. Others are archived. Don't hardcode the timestamp in the filename in this file.
