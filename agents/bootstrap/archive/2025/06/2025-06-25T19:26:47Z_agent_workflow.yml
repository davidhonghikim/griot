  title: "No Surprises"
  description: |
    Your goal is to perform your assigned task while leaving a clear, auditable trail of your work. 
    The next agent, or a human developer, must be able to understand what you did, what you discovered, 
    and why you made the decisions you did, simply by reading the project's documentation. 
    Do not invent your own systems. Follow this one precisely.

      guidelines:
        log_major_tasks: "Instead of logging every `edit_file` or `run_terminal_cmd` call, batch your work into logical units. Create a single log entry when a significant, multi-step task is complete."

        entry_types:
          finding: "The discovery of a significant issue"
          correction: "A direct action taken to fix a FINDING"
          decision: "A choice made between multiple implementation options. State the rationale"
      example_log_entries:
        - "**2025-06-25T18:35:00Z**: FINDING - Discovered a `MessageType` mismatch between specifications and the core protocol."
        - "**2025-06-25T19:10:00Z**: ACTION - Completed the full 5-part specification suite for the Griot Node."
