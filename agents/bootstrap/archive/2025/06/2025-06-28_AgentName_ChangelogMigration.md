## 2025-06-28T22:30:00Z – Claude-Sonnet-4 (MISSION: Project review and systematic modular breakdown continuation)
* CHANGE: ONBOARDING - Session started. Reviewed system prompt, workflow, architecture framework, and handoff directive.
* ERROR: Logging script (scripts/kos-log.js) has ES module error - falling back to manual logging as per workflow.
* CHANGE: Beginning comprehensive project review as requested by user to understand current state and identify next priorities.
* FINDING: **MODULAR BREAKDOWN STATUS VERIFIED** - 5 node architectures have modular breakdowns:
  - Amauta: 190 lines main + 4 modules (1,246 lines) - GOLD STANDARD
  - Ronin: 192 lines main + 4 modules (1,159 lines) - COMPLETE
  - Musa: 247 lines main + 4 modules (2,732 lines) - COMPLETE  
  - Hakim: 249 lines main + 4 modules (1,547 lines) - COMPLETE
  - Griot: 4 modules exist (1,762 lines) BUT main file still 750 lines - INCOMPLETE
* FINDING: **HANDOFF DIRECTIVE CORRECTION** - Ronin Architecture is actually COMPLETE (192 lines), not 800 lines as claimed
* FINDING: **CORRECTED PRIORITY TARGETS** - Verified remaining large architecture files:
  - Griot Architecture: 750 lines (Priority 1) - INCOMPLETE modular breakdown, needs main file transformation
  - Griot KLF API: 791 lines (Priority 2) - not yet started
  - Yachay Architecture: 760 lines (Priority 3) - not yet started
  - Archon Architecture: 709 lines (Priority 4) - not yet started

  - Real-time Media Processor: 1,282 lines
  - Content Publisher: 1,246 lines
  - Image Processor: 1,221 lines
  - Media Pipeline Manager: 1,130 lines
* DECISION: **COMPLETE INCOMPLETE GRIOT WORK FIRST** - Transform Griot main architecture file from 750 lines to modular overview following Amauta pattern, since modules already exist.
* CHANGE: **GRIOT ARCHITECTURE TRANSFORMATION COMPLETE** - Successfully transformed Griot main architecture file from 750-line detailed implementation to clean modular overview following Amauta gold standard pattern with proper module references, HIEROS integration, and implementation guidelines.
* FINDING: **UPDATED PRIORITY TARGETS** - With Griot now complete, next systematic modular breakdown priorities:

  - Yachay Architecture: 760 lines (Priority 2) - not yet started
  - Archon Architecture: 709 lines (Priority 3) - not yet started
* DECISION: **CONTINUE SYSTEMATIC MODULAR BREAKDOWN** - Continue with Priority 1 target: Griot KLF API (791 lines) following proven Amauta methodology.
* CHANGE: **GRIOT KLF API MODULAR BREAKDOWN STARTED** - Beginning systematic breakdown of 791-line Griot KLF API specification into 4 comprehensive modules:
  - Module 1: Core KLF Replication API - Essential replication operations and basic request/response patterns
  - Module 2: Advanced Configuration & Parameters - Comprehensive configuration options for sophisticated replication scenarios
