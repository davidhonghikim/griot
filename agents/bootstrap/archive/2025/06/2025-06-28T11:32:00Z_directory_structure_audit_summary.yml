executive_summary: |
  Successfully completed a comprehensive audit and cleanup of the agents directory structure, 
  ensuring complete consistency with the established archive policy and format standards. 
  All directories now follow the proper year/month structure with correct timestamps and logical organization.

issues_found_and_fixed:
  performance_directory_structure:
    issue: "Mixed flat files and year/month structure"
    problem: "Had both `2025-06-29_*.md` files in root AND `2025/06/` structure"
    solution: "Moved all dated files to `archive/2025/06/` structure"
    result: "Clean, consistent archive structure"
  
  implementation_plans_archive:
    issue: "Mixed archive structures"
    problem: "Had both flat directories (`06-28_kos-starseed-restructure/`) and year/month structure"
    solution: "Consolidated all archives into `archive/2025/06/` structure"
    result: "Single, consistent archive policy"
  
  handoff_archive_structure:
    issue: "Flat structure instead of year/month"
    problem: "All handoff files were in flat `archive/` directory"
    solution: "Organized into proper `archive/YYYY/MM/` structure"
    result: "Consistent with other systems"
  
  incorrect_date_files:
    issue: "Files with wrong dates in wrong locations"
    problem: "Files from 2024-07 and 2025-01 in `incorrect_dates/` directory"
    solution: "Moved to proper `archive/2024/07/` and `archive/2025/01/` structures"
    result: "Proper chronological organization"
  
  legacy_archive_structures:
    issue: "Old archive structures from previous systems"
    problem: "`archives/` directory with legacy app structures"
    solution: "Removed legacy structures"
    result: "Clean, current archive system only"

  summary: |
    The agents directory structure is now completely consistent and properly organized. 
    All systems follow the established archive policy with year/month structure, proper timestamps, 
    and logical file organization. The structure is ready for database changes and provides a clean, 
    maintainable foundation for future development.
