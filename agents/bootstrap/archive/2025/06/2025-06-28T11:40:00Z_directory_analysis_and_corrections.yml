conclusion:
  status: "CORRECTED"
  quality: "IMPROVED"
  next_session: "Ready for RAG operations extension with clean, properly organized structure"
  summary: |
    The directory structure has been corrected to properly separate current system files from historical archives. 
    The distinction between execution plans (agent performance tracking) and implementation plans (project-level planning) 
    is now clear and documented. The system maintains proper organization while preserving historical data and current functionality.
