plan_lifecycle_detailed:
  title: "Plan Lifecycle"
  description: "This directory manages the lifecycle of implementation plans for the project. All plans follow a strict backlog -> active -> archive workflow."
  
  stages:
    backlog:
      title: "backlog/"
      description: "Contains all approved but not-yet-started implementation plans"
      to_create_new_plan: "Do NOT create directories manually. Use the helper script to ensure correct date formatting."
      command: "./agents/shared/scripts/create-plan-dir.sh 'your-plan-name'"
      result: "This will create a new directory like backlog/2025-07-01_your-plan-name/. Add your plan.yml and other assets there."
