# Genesis Initiative Master Plan

## 1. Overview

This master plan unifies the goals of the "kOS Starseed Restructure" and the "Persona Forge System." It outlines the critical path to transform kOS from a file-based system into a dynamic, database-driven AI orchestration platform with a flexible agent persona management system.

## 2. Phases & High-Level Goals

*   **Phase 1: Foundational Database & API Setup.** Establish the core infrastructure, including database connections, schemas, and the basic API for the Persona Forge.
*   **Phase 2: Dynamic Persona Management.** Build the core functionality of the Persona Forge, allowing personas and skills to be loaded from files, managed in the database, and composed dynamically.
*   **Phase 3: Advanced Memory & AI Integration.** Implement the specialized Starseed memory patterns and begin leveraging the new database architecture for advanced AI capabilities like vector search and knowledge composition.

## 3. Detailed Tasks

### Phase 1: Foundational Database & API Setup (Depends on nothing)
- [ ] **Task 1.1**: Set up MongoDB, Weaviate, and Neo4j infrastructure (Docker or cloud).
- [ ] **Task 1.2**: Establish core database connection library in the `griot-node` src.
- [ ] **Task 1.3**: Define initial Mongoose schemas for `Skill` and `Persona`.
- [ ] **Task 1.4**: Build a placeholder KLF-compatible API service with basic health check endpoints.

### Phase 2: Dynamic Persona Management (Depends on Phase 1)
- [ ] **Task 2.1**: Implement the `/import` service to read all YAML files from `agents/skills` and `agents/personas` and populate the database.
- [ ] **Task 2.2**: Implement the `GET /personas/:id` endpoint, including the logic to fetch and compose imported skills.
- [ ] **Task 2.3**: Implement the `PUT /personas/:id/live` endpoint to allow for dynamic, in-memory updates to personas.
- [ ] **Task 2.4**: Implement the `POST /personas/:id/export` service to save a database persona back to the file system as a new version.
- [ ] **Task 2.5**: Create a basic command-line interface (CLI) in `scripts/` to test the API endpoints.

### Phase 3: Starseed Memory & AI Integration (Depends on Phase 2)
- [ ] **Task 3.1**: Implement the Griot memory pattern (cultural preservation) using the new database structure.
- [ ] **Task 3.2**: Implement the Yachay memory pattern (Andean ecological memory cycles), leveraging Neo4j for relationships.
- [ ] **Task 3.3**: Begin vector embedding generation for all documentation and sync to Weaviate.
- [ ] **Task 3.4**: Implement a basic semantic search API endpoint that queries Weaviate.
- [ ] **Task 3.5**: Create migration scripts for existing markdown content into the new database structures.
