title: "Security Implementation Plan"

status: "ACTIVE"
priority: "CRITICAL"
estimated_duration: "4-6 sessions"
overview: |
  Comprehensive security implementation plan for the kOS project, focusing on a defense-in-depth approach with modular, reusable security components. All security measures will be implemented as modular services that can be imported and used across all agents and services.
architecture_principles:
  modular_design:
    - "Reusable Components: All security functions as importable modules"
    - "Single Responsibility: Each security module handles one specific concern"
    - "Dependency Injection: Security services injected where needed"
    - "Configuration Driven: Security settings externalized and configurable"
  defense_in_depth:
    - "Multiple Layers: Security at input, processing, storage, and output layers"
    - "Fail Secure: Default to deny, explicit allow"
    - "Zero Trust: Validate everything, trust nothing"
    - "Principle of Least Privilege: Minimal required permissions"
phases:
  - phase: 1
    priority: "High"
    duration: "Session 1-2"
    focus: "Core security foundations"
    tasks:

        location: "packages/data/core/security/file_security.ts"
        components:
          - "Path validation and sanitization"
          - "Safe file operations"
          - "YAML/JSON safe loading"
          - "Symlink attack prevention"
          - "File permission validation"
      - id: "1.2"
        name: "Authentication & Authorization Module"
        location: "packages/data/core/security/auth_manager.ts"
        components:
          - "JWT token management"
          - "User authentication"
          - "Role-based access control (RBAC)"
          - "Session management"
          - "Permission checking"
      - id: "1.3"
        name: "Enhanced Input Validation Module"
        location: "packages/data/core/security/input_validator.ts"
        enhancements:
          - "Schema validation"
          - "Type coercion prevention"
          - "Advanced injection detection"
          - "Rate limiting integration"
          - "Context-aware validation"
  - phase: 2
    priority: "Medium"
    duration: "Session 3-4"
    focus: "Network and data security"
    tasks:
      # ... (Tasks for Phase 2)
  - phase: 3
    priority: "Low"
    duration: "Session 5-6"
    focus: "Monitoring and compliance"
    tasks:
      # ... (Tasks for Phase 3)
