          ### SESSION SUMMARY:
          **Accomplishments**: 
          - Fixed dark theme implementation across all popup components
          - Verified and confirmed full service editing functionality exists
          - Updated ServiceForm, ServiceManagement, and ServiceItem components to use custom CSS variables
          - Successfully rebuilt extension with proper dark theme
          - Started server for testing and validation
          
          **Final State**: 
          The PersonaRAG Bridge extension now has a proper dark theme throughout all components. The popup service editing functionality was already complete and working - users can add, edit, delete, and manage services with full CRUD operations. All components use consistent custom CSS variables for theming.
          
          **Key Findings**: 
          - CSS variables were defined as hex colors but used with rgb() function, causing theme failure
          - Service editing functionality was already fully implemented but using old color classes
          - All service management features (add, edit, delete, archive, status check) are operational
          - Dark theme now properly applied across popup, tab, and sidepanel contexts
