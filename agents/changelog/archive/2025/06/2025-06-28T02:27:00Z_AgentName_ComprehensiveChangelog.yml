        description: "Build analysis reveals 8 TypeScript errors across 4 files, confirming handoff assessment: ComfyUI parameter mapping missing targetPath property, vector databases missing required endpoints (query/upsert/delete), networking parameter structure issues."

        description: "Framework architecture is highly sophisticated - universal adapter pattern with 21 comprehensive connectors across 5 categories, well-structured type system, excellent modularity and organization."

    session_summary:
      accomplishments:
        - "Analyzed existing comprehensive service connector framework with 21 connectors"
        - "Implemented complete type system for universal service connector framework"
        - "Established HTTPS-first protocol strategy with HTTP fallback for local services"
        - "Identified framework architecture: universal adapter pattern enabling any service abstraction"
      final_state: "Service connector framework exists with comprehensive connector definitions but requires completion of protocol fallback logic and final build verification. Types are implemented but build still has remaining issues with vector database endpoints and parameter mapping."
      key_findings:
        - "Framework already implements the 'universal adapter' pattern from kai-cd reference"
        - "21 connectors organized by category with sophisticated parameter mapping (especially ComfyUI)"
        - "Protocol strategy needs smart fallback: HTTPS default with HTTP fallback for local services"
        - "Build issues remain with missing vector database endpoints and ComfyUI parameter mapping extensions"

        description: "Implemented comprehensive types.ts with all required interfaces: ServiceDefinition, capabilities (LLM, ImageGen, VectorDB, etc.), authentication, and parameter definitions."

        type: "CHANGE"
        description: "Updated protocol handling: HTTPS as default for cloud services (OpenAI, Anthropic, HuggingFace, Dropbox, etc.), HTTP for local services (Ollama, ComfyUI, A1111, etc.)."

        description: "User emphasized need for HTTP fallback capability for local hosted services, not just compilation fixes but proper protocol handling."
