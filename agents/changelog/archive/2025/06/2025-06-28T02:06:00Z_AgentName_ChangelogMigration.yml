    session_summary:
      accomplishments:
        - "Successfully completed comprehensive project review verifying all claimed modular breakdown progress"
        - "Confirmed 4 complete modular architectures (Amauta, Musa, Hakim, Frontend Architecture) with proven gold standard methodology"
        - "Verified Mind Implementation Kit also has complete modular breakdown (mind_modules directory with 4 modules)"
        - "Validated all 5 priority targets with correct line counts for continued systematic modular breakdown"
        - "Confirmed project structure integrity with all 13 nodes properly organized and consistently named"
        - "Identified additional large files in ai-q/05_modules/ as potential future modular breakdown targets"
      final_state: "The kOS project has a solid foundation with systematic modular breakdown methodology successfully established and proven across 5 complete architectures. The Amauta gold standard pattern is well-established with consistent 4-module structures, comprehensive cross-references, and HIEROS compliance. Clear priorities exist for continued systematic breakdown of 5 remaining node architecture files."
      key_findings:
        - "Previous agent's handoff directive is accurate and actionable with all claimed progress verified"
        - "Systematic modular breakdown methodology is proven and ready for continued application"
        - "Project structure integrity is excellent with all 13 nodes properly organized"
        - "Additional large files in ai-q/05_modules/ (1,200+ lines) represent future modular breakdown opportunities"
        - "Cultural sensitivity and HIEROS compliance maintained throughout all completed modules"
