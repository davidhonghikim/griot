## Agent: Gemini-1.5-Pro - 2025-06-25

**Mission**: Analyze the `griot-node/agents` directory for context, then perform a deep, critical review of the entire project, assuming prior errors. Correct all issues, update documentation, and establish a robust, consistent workflow for future agents.

### Log:
- **2025-06-25 18:00:00 UTC**: Session started. Initial analysis revealed a significant gap between abstract specifications and the detail required for implementation.
- **2025-06-25 18:05:00 UTC**: Began systematic refactoring and enhancement of 7 core node specifications, creating a new 5-part structure for each (Overview, Architecture, Data Models, KLF API, DB Schema, Code Examples).
- **2025-06-25 18:10:00 UTC**: Completed specifications for Griot, Tohunga, Ronin, and Musa.
- **2025-06-25 18:15:00 UTC**: Authored complete specifications from scratch for Hakim, Skald, and Oracle.
- **2025-06-25 18:20:00 UTC**: Updated the main `README.md` and `FINAL_HANDOFF.md` to reflect the new documentation structure and project status.
- **2025-06-25 18:25:00 UTC**: Began comprehensive self-review of all 35+ generated documents.
- **2025-06-25 18:30:00 UTC**: **Finding #1:** Discovered the Griot class was missing a KLF API specification entirely.
- **2025-06-25 18:31:00 UTC**: Executed `edit_file` to create `03_Griot_KLF_API.md`, correcting the omission.
- **2025-06-25 18:35:00 UTC**: **Finding #2:** Discovered a `MessageType` mismatch between specifications (e.g., `EVENT_PUBLISH`) and the core protocol (`EVENT`).
- **2025-06-25 18:36:00 UTC**: Executed `edit_file` on Skald and Hakim API specs to align them with the correct `MessageType` enums from `types.ts`.
- **2025-06-25 18:40:00 UTC**: **Finding #3:** Discovered the Tohunga spec files were not correctly named.
- **2025-06-25 18:41:00 UTC**: Executed `run_terminal_cmd` to rename all Tohunga files to the correct `[##_Tohunga_Filename].md` format.
- **2025-06-25 18:45:00 UTC**: Created `agents/06_Final_Review_And_Analysis.md` to formally document the review process and the "spec vs. code" gap.
- **2025-06-25 18:50:00 UTC**: Executed `run_terminal_cmd` to commit all changes and run the `archive.sh` script, preserving the work.
- **2025-06-25 18:55:00 UTC**: **Finding #4:** Received user feedback that the agent workflow itself is inconsistent and chaotic.
- **2025-06-25 18:56:00 UTC**: Devised and implemented a new, mandatory agent workflow centered around this changelog and a structured handoff process.

### SESSION SUMMARY:
This session successfully transformed the project from a state of conceptual abstraction to engineering clarity. All seven core node classes now have complete, consistent, and buildable blueprints in the `ai-q/03_node_specifications/` directory. A rigorous self-review process was conducted, and several critical errors in the initial work were found and corrected.

Most importantly, a new, mandatory agent workflow has been established to ensure all future work is consistent, auditable, and clearly documented. The project is now in a robust state, ready for the next phase of development.
